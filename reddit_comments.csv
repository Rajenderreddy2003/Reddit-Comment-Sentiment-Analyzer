1mhu1u4,"I was a server at a really nice restaurant and ended up working a dinner in our private room for the president of a major movie production studio's birthday. One of the guests at the dinner was apparently a major producer and insanely rich. 

I heard them discussing how he had decided to collect EVERY BOTTLE of a very nice wine maker's specific vintage (to put into context this bottle would probably go for about $2000 per in a restaurant, not sure what retail would be) and had a full time employee tracking down private collections and restaurant wine cellars that might have bottles. At that point he had over 4000 bottles of the one wine, organized by serial number in a custom-made cellar. 

He told a story about how Martin Scorsese had badmouthed a franchise he funded and when he later called looking for funding for The Irishman he told him to ""go fuck himself"".

At one point in the dinner his assistant (one of three assistants sitting at the end of the long dinner table) informed him that the first truffles of the season had been delivered to some chef in Tokyo. So producer guy goes ""Great! Anyone want to go to Tokyo this weekend for a truffle tasting?"" A couple of people said yes so he instructed the assistant to ""make sure one of the jets is available"" for the trip. 

They stayed 3 hours after we closed. Bought every bottle of the same brand of wine (different vintage) we had in our cellar ""for the road"", let me taste a 1989 Chateau Haut-Brion and tipped $3600 for the lateness of their departure.

There was a mansion there and as part of the deal the bridal party got to stay at the mansion.  The owner is almost never actually there.  He lives in a big White House, if you know what I mean.

I show up early the morning of the wedding and I’m greeted by the butler.  Who’s more or less exactly like what you’d think, but younger and not English.  Throughout the day I was all over the mansion taking pictures.  During a lull I was chatting up the butler.

The weird thing was that he said it’s shift work, that there are basically three of them (maybe another guy for filling in, I’m not sure) and it’s 8 hour shifts.  So I was asking, since wedding stuff is kinda seasonal and it gets cold here, like if I showed up at 2am in January one of you would be here, all alone in the mansion, just knocking around on the odd chance the big guy shows up?  And he was like yeah, someone’s always here.

While we were there he unveiled his new car a custom built Daytona SP3 that was all completely custom. The base price of the car is around $2.2 million so with the customizations it was closer to $3 million the way he had it.

The crazy part was the story he told about it, this was supposed to be an early build number car but it was delayed. He had to ask Ferrari about why his $3 million dollar car was taking so long while he was putting in another order for a completely custom Ferrari that is probably worth even more than that.

1mhu1u4,"Years and years ago, assisted a photographer at a fundraising event at the country club for a very, very, VERY private gated community in the NC mountains.   The turn INTO the entire community was all but disguised as a junky old “mountain hollar” driveway.  No signage, missed it the first two times.   Absolutely GRILLED at the guard house before they let me through and then about 30 years into driving up:  holy shit, the Garden of Eden.   It was WILD how well hidden everything was.  

The event was at the country club and there were some very famous names in attendance.  It was my job to stand beside the photographer and write down the names of those in attendance as they lined up for their photo op with the famous names.   During the dinner, was upstairs inserting photos and polishing already-immaculate solid sterling picture frames that had to have weighed a couple of pounds each.  And then passing them off to a handful of staff with thousand-yard stares, to be arranged on tables by the doors upon exit (after the event ended).  

Then standing downstairs beside that table, checking names off a list as the donors/attendees left (and were supposed to pick up their parting gift).  Except it never really got that far, because….

The SHEER VOLUME of people who saw their photos in those frames just *tried to fucking steal them.*  Nevermind that they were clearly intended as a donor GIFT— that part didn’t even matter.   I was hired help, I had nothing to do with anything except the expectation that I’d hand them off and check a name off a list, **assuming** that the event organizers had shared that information with the attendees/donors.    I guess they didn’t?   People were literally swiping them and shoving them into their jackets, pockets, down pants and/or purses and hauling ass for the door while I stood there desperately trying to explain “It’s a gift! If you don’t mind, what’s your name so I may check it off that you received yours?”   

That went down like a lead balloon.  Apparently being told that something was intended as a gift **after you already fucking stole it** was considered rude.   Maybe you should have asked before you tried to shove it down your pants???

I am a regular guy who has been clean and sober for 26 years.

I live in a very high cost of living area about 90 miles up the 101 from LA.

A fellow friend of Bill happened to be (and still is) rather a big deal in the entertainment industry.  He would (no longer) have very large very opulent Christmas parties peppered with mostly entertainment folks.  Some in front of the camera and others behind.  Others like myself are regular people who happen to have a friend who exists in an extraordinary situation.

In any event, at one of the Christmas parties, I and my date got up from the table to go to the dessert station.  It took a few minutes before we  went back to our seats.  As soon as we got near the table I was furious.  Some lady had taken my seat. (I didn't leave a jacket, but thought my clearly full beverage and gift bag were sufficient notice). I approached the table 100% ready to talk some shit.  As I neared the lady looked familiar.  I scanned my mind as to where I knew her from.  About 2 seconds later she spoke and I knew it was Nicole Kidman.

I am not one to get star struck in general.  However I suggested to my date that we find another table while she whispered ""was that Nicole Kidman and her new guy in our seats?"" Into my ear.

I am not wealthy  and will not likely ever be famous.

I know that sounds ridiculous, but with the way anything vaguely pornographic is being taken off of steam and itch and whatnot, I've recently been discussing it with people IRL and talking about how it's concerning that payment processors have this much power and control and are willing to use it.

So long as it's legal, bloody *payment processors* shouldn't have some ability to decide what people spend their money on. Itch and Steam have no obligation to host it, and I understand that legally speaking, payment processers are (in most places) under no obligation to handle transactions. 

However, the precedent it sets is incredibly concerning, and while I personally am not all *that* bothered by the specific content that was affected, I am bothered by the fact that they might next decide that something I do like is ""immoral"".

But of course, that line of logic quickly devolves into puritanical nonsense with more than one person saying to me ""well some of that stuff was \[non-traditional porn genre\]"", and like yes, there are a **lot** of kinks and fetishes that I don't even understand and personally find off-putting. However, just because I don't like it doesn't mean that massive companies should be allowed to unilaterally decide that it's ""not ok"".

So I'm stuck either leaving the conversation there with this person thinking they've won a moral victory and believing I'm sort of deviant, or I have to try to get it through their head that defending something doesn't mean I like it (always a losing battle).",260,Somerandom1922,1754324158.0

Even if we disregard the risks of cutting off blood flow, it is very, very easy to slip and crush a windpipe. It can also be pretty difficult to remember whatever tap out method you agreed to previously when your vision is going black and you start to panic.


Im not trying to stop people from engaging in it in general, but the fact that it's gotten so popular in the last couple of decades has definitely led to some misconceptions about the safety involved.

Making people laugh, smile, or help with their education on wine is what I do best. I’ve also always been that guy who steps in to help in an emergency. I’ve had someone else’s blood up to my elbows trying to save their lives. In another life I 100% would have been at least a paramedic. 

I’m medically retired at 62 due to the medications I’ve had to take for 21 years since I received a life saving heart ❤️ transplant. The last couple of years have been tough. I’m single, a good cook, and mostly self sufficient. 

My faith tells me that the afterlife will be amazing, but that our time here is a one &amp; done. We won’t come back. I want to squeeze every bit of the experience here on earth for what it can teach me. 

Heartfelt admission here: I’ve been literally on my knees praying, recently, because it’s no longer in my physical capacity to help others, to care for or help them in an emergency. I mourn that loss of ability more than I can express. 

My life is changing and the next version will certainly be interesting, but I stand through pain &amp; weakness, a warrior born, and will not go easy into that good night. I don’t quit. I’ve already punched the Grim Reaper in the snoot twice: Next time he better be ready for a fight.

If it's going back in time, I'd try to convince my parents to make specific investments (since I didn't have a lot of my own money as a teenager) that would result in generational wealth that could be benefitting their grandchildren today.

If it's just suddenly waking up in today's world as a teenager again, it would actually be pretty upsetting.  It would be really difficult to convince my daughter that I'm her father even though I'm only 6-10 years older than she is, would be likely impossible to keep my current job because I'm no longer an adult, and my home would likely end up being foreclosed on.  Assuming I could convince my family that I'm me, I'd probably have to move back in with my parents and start over.  My degree would likely be worthless because I wouldn't be able to convince anyone that I got a college education as a toddler.  I'd pretty much have to just start all over.  It would also pretty much doom me to being alone because I would absolutely not want to date anyone my age.  I'd still feel like a fully grown adult inside and it would be creepy to try and find a partner my physical age.  It would feel predatory.  Older women would also want nothing to do with me, because to them, I'm a kid.

I know i wont be able to buy my own since exchanges didnt exist yet, i dont have my own bank account, and my parents arent going to send money to some dude on 4chan for some coin that on paper sounds like a ponzi scheme. Then, im taking several weeks during the summer to have a break. Like im legit sitting outside and taking a deep breath of air knowing i dont have to go to work tomorrow. When school does show up im passing as many classes as possible. I'll attempt to be social this time instead of a recluse the issue is who i am now is who i became from that time period so i dont think i can exactly re-write history here. My brain is effectively developed by this point im just in my body at 13. I had a ""girlfriend"" at 13. Not sure if i would keep her or let it break off like it did originally. Mainly saying this because i would be very uncomfortable dating a girl that young even if i am in the body of someone who is 13. I would let her down FAR more gently than i did originally at that age. I would then exercise more, dress better and in general do the things i wish i had more time to develop. I would for sure spend as much time as possible enjoying 2011's internet and outside world. And this sounds weird but i would drink FAR more whole milk too since i would just be beginning puberty and this would allow me to be a normal height rather than 8 inches shorter than most guys around me. 

If i am 18 im telling my dad to get his heart checked out because hes going to die in like 6 months. This time period is honestly the worst time period to go back to. Like its too late to really change anything, crypto is crazy expensive so the gains, although can be made, arent going to be as massive as when i was 13 and now i have to relive some of the worst experiences in my life. I have a bank account in this scenario so i guess i set up a few crypto accounts and stock trading accounts, buy a bunch of GME, bitcoin and etherium. Tbh the thought of going back to this time period fills me with absolute dread and anxiety. I would have a girlfriend again during this time but i know shes going to cheat on me. I could try to prevent that since i was wishy washy and thats probably why she cheated. I did have some girls into me back then i was just too socially reclusive to do anything. I guess with the confidence now and knowing that the future holds...nothing in that regard i would take my chances with some of them rather than avoid them.

1mhhb1o,"Supposing this means that I'm going back in time, there are some *obvious* things related to being staggeringly wealthy by now, but that's a rather dull answer.  So instead of the universal answer that'd let me have a Scrooge McDuck money vault and the terrifying power that comes with wealth, I'm going to go with the more specific stuff.

When I was a teen, I was saddled with three rather dire problems that I'd not understand for quite some time.  The first and most pressing is that I am on the autism spectrum.  These days people aren't likely to guess as much and instead consider me mildly eccentric, but as a teen I was an *unbearable twit*.  Learning this fact, accepting that the problem was indeed with me and not the world as a whole and then developing the skills to meet the world in the middle took me well into adulthood.  Going back with those tools would make dealing with the other two things a hell of a lot easier.

The second is that I am trans and while the particular intersection of this bit of revisionist history makes that a rather *unfortunate* thing to be, knowing as much would help make navigating that entire part of my life a hell of a lot easier.  Indeed my generally level of queerness can be lumped into this as well.  Yes, often my interest in girls was for the reasons you'd expect of a teen, but frequently it was that I thought they were cool and wanted to be friends with them.  You'd think that'd be obvious, but then you'd also think it'd be obvious that my interest in boys wasn't always because they were cool and I wanted to be friends with them.  Between autism leaving me blind and deaf to a hell of a lot of information required to navigate society and not being able to grasp who the hell I was, I was a forever fucking weirdo.

The third is the trickiest thing of all to navigate because not long after my teens I'd meet the woman who would be my wife.  Both of us were queer when we met and neither realized it and so the grand task of this entire experiment would be to somehow figure out how to navigate that relationship.  I've a small edge that makes this somewhat less than hopeless.  Being mutual weirdos about a hell of a lot, I do have information that, if shared, will apparently suffice to convince her that I am, in fact, a time traveler.  I suppose I *could* try taking up ballet - that's what she was doing when we met - but honestly I don't think my failure to participate in that has anything to do with not grasping that I'm trans and everything in the world to do with the fact that I don't inhabit my body so much as drunkenly operate it while while distracted by cartoons.

Duct cleaning.

Duct cleaners will tell you how much NADCA recommends it. Well of course the National Air Duct Cleaners Association recommends it. I bet the National Association of Dog Fighters also recommend having dog fights.

The EPA doesn't really recommend cleaning your ducts unless there is mold or pests. 

Except dryer ducts. Keep your dryer ducts clean! But if your dryer duct was designed/installed correctly and you bought the correct dryer, this shouldn't really be an issue.

For those that notice you have dust on your duct walls, it's no big deal. Dust on the walls are not floating around in the air. Why mess with it?",19,CaptainAwesome06,1754351774.0

The stock market has shown itself to be a rigged game, where the rules change depending on who you are. It's 'governed' by an arm of the government that has no hands. The SEC is a poor (literally) regulatory body that can't hold anyone who is rich accountable. These companies can do what they want. They pump stocks up, short them and destroy companies, and manipulate the game along the way to suit them.

They’re sold the American dream, and they fall for it. They take on massive student debt with the hope that it’ll all be worth it. But after graduating, there are no real job opportunities waiting for them. The only option left is to do another shitty degree or a master’s program, piling on even more debt. Before they know it, their visa expires, and they’re kicked out, dumped back into their home country like an empty juice box after being sucked dry.

I get frustrated that people don’t understand when we lift each other up, even those different from us, we all benefit. You may not know or interact with people or communities that use DEI, but the more people that have economic security, the better the economy, resources are more plentiful, and that can impact them financially in a positive way.

1mhq3i3,"People who refuse to communicate *anything* until it's like, a fucking problem. 

I've gone to sooo many people and been like ""hey! Just a heads up I'm bad at reading social queues and shit. If I'm ever doing anything at all that's upsetting you or even bugging you, please let me know immediately and I'll stop or figure out a solution! :) "" 

And every single time I'm PROMISED ""oh of course!! Don't worry I will!!""

Then sometimes MONTHS later get met with ""hey you've done all these things/done this one this a bunch of times and I hate you now."" 

The worst part is that I notice little things, like tone shifts or facial expressions. But I'm also a very anxious person with trauma and I often think people are mad at me when they're not. So I *ask a bunch of times* if I'm doing something wrong. And not in a weird shitty way either. Just ""hey you seem a bit uncomfortable, did I do something wrong?"" And they'll LIE TO MY FACE.

Their reasoning? Every single time? As to why they didn't tell me sooner? One of two things:

1) well it should have been obvious 
2) I didn't wanna hurt your feelings

Bro

If I'm talking about something that's triggering you, I'm not gonna be offended that you told me it's a sensitive topic for you. If I'm being loud I'm not gonna be offended if you ask me to lower my voice. If I'm talking too much? Honestly I might be a bit sad if you ask me to talk less tbh, but that's a me problem, not a you problem. I would *much fucking rather* you tell me the first time it happens so I can avoid it, rather than do it for months on end and have you not like me anymore lmfaooo 

Gives me such a massive insecurity and distrust when people tell me I'm not doing anything wrong, because so many people have so convincingly lied to my face and said the same thing.

The people who are actually close to me know very very well that if you ask me to avoid/change something, and it's reasonable, I'll do it. 

And it's not just me. I've seen this happen to so many people I know. 

So ffs, if someone's doing something you really don't like, just *tell them*",7,greenbeanextreme,1754351937.0

Oh my god, and yes to the poop stories! At one point I was in charge of the “sanitation” contract. We had a vendor who vastly underestimated and couldn’t keep up with the demand one year (the event was oversold), and literal pyramids of poop above the toilet seats all over site during the event was the result. People on acid would open up the door to a porta potty after standing in line for 20 minutes and just burst into tears, then add their bit to the pyramid. I have no idea what they used to wipe. Also one year we had a bout of food poisoning hit our production commissary. One of my crewmates ended up shitting in his own cooler since he was stuck and super sick in his tent for a couple days. I have PTSD from the poop stories. But other memorable things found/dealt with after some festivals:

-an entire shipping container full of confiscated nitrous oxide. Fun times. 

-an entire shipping container full of booze and strange weapons like a samurai sword. It was a no glass festival so a lot of folks just didn’t come back to pick up their liquor at the end. Also fun times!

-another entire shipping container full of perfectly good Floaties: Rafts, flamingos, inner tubes, and and Armada’s worth of all sorts of blow up stuff. Even some blowup dolls! That festival was on a lake. 

-$1000 was found in an abandoned backpack one year. 

-COUNTLESS DRUGS. 

-thousands of bikes (burning man, but also others)

-many shipping containers worth of tents and sleeping bags and camping gear, etc. I’ve literally used a front end loader to deal with that kind of stuff. 

-cell phones and headlamps and water bottles unending  

One of the first big festivals I worked was lollapalooza in Chicago, and I brought a large sculpture. The production crew dropped off a forklift and a golf cart to us for teardown. At one point I drove over to the main production HQ to get paid, and they had put out about 100 cases of really nice booze to be picked up. I took about 50 cases and didn’t buy vodka, whiskey, or açai liqeur(?) for like three years. 

Things I have personally salvaged from festival cleanup: a motorcycle, a side-by-side, about half the lumber in the house I’m building, the sod for my front lawn, a 25’ tipi, a quarter mile of fencing, high-end rigging and safety gear, and a large percentage of my hand and surveying tools.

1mhg3nu,"Back in 2009, I was visiting friends on campus at UGA. Well, there was an absolute insane tailgate party at the quad just before a game, and no joke, the entire quad was covered in trash that was about a foot high. I’ve never seen anything like it to this day. It was like someone setup a fantastic tailgate and then let bulls stampede through it. We weren’t at the game, but just walking around downtown while the game was happening. So when we found it, it was right after the party.

Anyways, we found all kinds of stuff: tents, stereos, chairs, grills, coolers, some really nice clothing and jackets, lots of beers, etc, but most of it was destroyed or broken or gross. The craziest thing we found was a dude who had blacked out drunk and was completely hidden in the trash. There were other people walking around the quad, and when we found him, some people came over and said they had been looking for this dude for over an hour before we found him.

After that, I believe it took several days to clean it all up, and I think UGA banned any tailgating in the quad for a few years.

No pictures, but here’s an article about the trash when it happened: https://www.redandblack.com/news/tailgate-trash-what-happens-to-campus-on-game-days/article_aa92a61f-6b94-555c-bbdb-131355cb0c0d.html",12,accountability_bot,1754365626.0

The beds were the platform type so they had an empty space underneath them which could accommodate a large amount of articles. While removing the bed in one room, we stumbled upon a sizable stash of pornographic materials.
When we removed the box spring and mattress from the bed, the materials were visible.

Several DVDs, magazines, lingerie and “toys” were scattered around this hidden compartment under the bed. We all had a good laugh and a few of the guys picked up the toys and waved them around at each other. The foreman on the job was notified and he said to throw it in the trash, but since he didn’t stick around to make sure, I doubt very much of it ended up in the trash.",9,imacmadman22,1754364640.0

About 3/4 of the way through the show, I watched him get up look around and crawl into a base bin speaker of the right speaker stack. I figured you wouldn't last too long in there but I never saw him come out. When the show ended I had to be sure he was out of there before we started ripping stuff down so I crawled in the basement and sure enough he was still in there I went in to drag him out and as soon as I was inside with him somebody kicked over a guitar or something on stage which made a large thump and immediately I was covered with nothing but vomit he had vomited all over the speaker itself.

I've had some celeb deaths hit me hard in the past, but this one....this one really hurt.  I saw this on Facebook and it really hit home. It was posted on the day his funeral cortege made its way through his hometown. I watched, and cried, like so many others did. But every post I saw, every song I heard afterwards tore at my heart.     
  
(No idea who wrote this first, because it's been shared and re-shared so many times, but credit goes to whoever did - and a personal thank-you from me, for putting what I felt into words.)

*Some ask ""why are so many people mourning over Ozzy? People act like they knew the man!”*   
  
*It's not just mourning over the man. It's mourning over a time in all of our lives that we can never go back to. Every song holds a place and time of a memory for us. Every song reminds us of our youth and our mortality. His music came at a time when we were teenagers or young adults. A worry free time of our lives. The time we felt carefree and life was endless. His songs were played at milestones in our lives, graduation parties, turning 21, weddings, driving your first car with the windows down and the music blaring.*  
  
*His family lost a husband, father, brother, son and friend.*   
  
*We lost a little part of our youth.*  
  
*Today, as the world watches his final procession through Birmingham. We say goodbye not only to the man, but to a piece of our own past.*",23,Round-Public435,1754356091.0

1mhfnv3,"You have an apples-to-oranges problem, here.

Education is funded at the state level, and the military is funded at the national level. While there may be some funds allocated to the states by the federal government, it is still up to the state to decide how, and if, to use those funds. We've already seen some states give up on things that would only help their poorer citizens, because they wanted to take a political stance about the presidential administration involved.

Worse, funding percolates down to school districts. So, while a state might get millions of dollars to improve school buildings, with the motivating idea that air conditioning is helpful in hot weather, what actually gets to a school district might end up being used for remodelling a principal's office, instead.",89,DrHugh,1754319729.0

1mhfnv3,"Probably nothing. The federal government spends $119 billion on education. If you want to add in state and local funding, it’s $857.2 billion but the question was about the military funding going to education so let’s stick with that. We’re higher than the OECD average in every meaningful category. In college per pupil funding, we’re at $36,274 which is 77% higher than the OECD average. In elementary per pupil funding we’re at $15,270 which is 28% higher than the OECD average. While we’re not first in this specific category, the countries ahead of us have much smaller populations (Iceland, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, and Austria.) In secondary school per pupil funding we’re at $16,301 which is 22% higher than the OECD average but, again, in fairness we are in 8th place behind Norway, Austria, South Korea, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Australia. However, our test scores are around or slightly above the OECD. The take away here is that we can’t solve a problem by throwing money at it. Education is a fiscal blackhole; you can spend however much you want and it will still never be enough. The problem isn’t money. The problem is how we educate. We have a very inefficient system that’s more interested in preparing students for tests than in actually learning or understanding. We have kind of the same problem as China who typically do very well on tests but aren’t very good at using the information they were taught in an organic manner",16,SpartanNation053,1754325057.0

Just replacing the 30 year old air handling equipment in one of our buildings would use that up. We are trying to pass a $4M bond just for that purpose.

1mhfnv3,"I think it would help a little in schools.  Schools in the US have a problem, and it’s not about money.

Yeah, some of it is, but the vast majority of it isn’t actually the money.

Now, I don’t say this lightly.  I have a vested interest in saying money would fix it.  I have two uncles, 3 aunts, both my mother and father in law, as well as my wife, who either works or have worked in public education as teachers (my uncle was a principle, but started as a teacher) for most of their lives.

The first problem is that the money rarely, if ever, even makes it to the school.  My father-in-law and uncle, who worked for two different school systems in two completely different states, have said the same thing.  For every dollar gained through grants and federal funding and things like that, *maybe* 65 cents makes it to the school corporation.  Before it makes it there, that money has to go through a handful of legislatures and committees and people that all get paid out of that money.  

Once in the corporation, about half, around 10-20 cents remains with the corporation to help pay for administrator salaries and raises that are contractually obligated (because, if you didn’t know, any sort of upper-level public school official often gets paid a ridiculous amount of money.  The superintendent of the school system where I grew up makes more than $200k, which is an awful lot of money when I grew up.  And he wasn’t even the highest paid.  They had 3 “consultants” that got paid a hefty amount for a number of things.  The tech consultants got paid the most, at least until an in-house group could be put together.  That contract, which helped get smart boards into a handful of rooms, was more than a million dollars over 3 years, and my school got…2 whole smart boards!  One in the library, and another in a “media” room that was adjacent to the library).  Another 10 cents goes to equipment that might be needed elsewhere - printers, computers, etc.

The rest - around 35 cents, goes to the school.  Sounds good, right?  But no.  Of that 35 cents, more than half, about 20 cents, goes to other programs - sports, clubs, initiatives, after-school programs, etc.  the rest makes it into actual education that would directly benefit students.

Oh, but that’s just the first problem!

Second problem!  It’s a big one, too.  It’s…a bit multifaceted.  But we can call it systemic problems.  This includes things like…inter school fighting.  What’s that?  It essentially means you have two schools in a system.  Both schools get 50% of the budget…but one school has a “graduation rate” or something similar of 80% and the other has one that’s 90%.

Well, now the school that passed 90%…only gets 40% of the budget.  The other school gets 60%.  Oh, and that 60% mostly goes to sports, because that’s a simple way to increase graduation rates.

That goes on everywhere.  The schools that produce better students gets…less funding.  So administrators have a vested interest in trying to keep their cut of the pie while also maintaining good graduation…which leads to the 2nd facet…and that’s standardized testing and “teaching to the test.”  Teaching to the test is a poor way to educate kids.  But it’s a very efficient way to test kids, especially if you’re a teacher and you have to read through and grade 6 classes worth of homework every night.  But the kids, if they did their homework at all, now know the answers to the test, but can’t apply that concept very well going forward, so you have to spend a lot of time of your school year going over what you already taught.  Well, the test scores look good!  And your pass rate looks good!  But your students are not well educated…except that one kid, who just gets it!  She’s really smart.  

So you start an initiative and put her in a class with other “exceptional” students who learn faster than other kids…but still learn at different rates than each other.  And it starts the inevitable competition along those students for “top student,” which contributes to the rampant clique problems in schools, not to mention bullying.  So the school has to also get an initiative going to prevent bullying, taking more money away because of that.

But there’s one more facet…and that’s student (and parent) participation.  If the kids and the parents don’t care, it doesn’t matter how much you have going in, it’s not going to help.  Schools need to find a way to make sure kids are invested in their own future.",6,betterthanamaster,1754328718.0

""But breakfast/lunch services are contracted!"" -- You are correct. And this is where the caveat comes into play of weeding out corruption. The cost of meals is currently stupid cheap, but for slop. Japan, for instance, has high quality food that is served. The children participate in cooking, cleaning, etc. We could easily do the same and just purchase ingredients and give the schools a well setup kitchen and let the kids learn to cook under supervision. This same thing applies for any other contracted thing. Bulk rates should be applied for things like computers and lab equipment. Any company trying to charge MORE than the standard cost should be blacklisted from participating without a compelling argument as to why they are charging more (demonstrable qualitative differences that make the cost an improvement for example, and the cost being publicly shown as to why... so you cant have a 1% improvement in performance but charge 100% more for example. Food quality cant be 1% better but be a 250% markup. It should be relative to the increase in manufacturing/production of the good being supplied).  
  
""But what about the religious side you mentioned?"" -- You can spend infinite amounts of money, but science, math, logic, reasoning... those skills require a separation from religion because you need to critically think. Religion promotes less logical thinking as you have to suspend the rules of logic and reasoning to have faith in a thing. Which is fine, no insult meant. Faith is meant to be BY FAITH and those that believe and try to inject science into it are not showing faith, they are trying to add post-hoc reasoning to something irrational and it just doesn't work in reality. Again, its fine to be religious, but religious institutions do not produce top scientists and mathematicians that make breakthroughs. They can, but they usually don't. Secular science and math is the way.  
 

However, my overall take is that opening the funding floodgates with nearly 300bn in funding would effectively transform the economy today for those in education, and the economy in general in the future.

Would it happen in reality, though? No. Too many people think we need a trillion dollar annual budget for military spending when in reality, we dont. We spend extra on r&amp;d with little extra to show for it. We pay not just cost + profit, but the profit margins are ridiculously high for government contractors. A bolt that cost $5 to manufacture is charged at $50 or more to the US government and we pay it. This is corruption. There is nothing to justify a 1000% markup except greed and corruption.

This means the cut would likely fall either on procurement or on maintenance. Let’s assume an even split.

Most procurement projects are cancelled and those that aren’t will be delayed and possibly bankrupt the companies that have the contracts if it’s a fixed cost (B21 for instance).

On maintenance, readiness rates fall of a cliff and it’s likely a lot of systems fall under 50% availability. Major parts of the U.S. arsenal, if not a majority, would have to be scrapped (or mothballed) and cannibalized to maintain the rest of the arsenal.

If it went to teacher salaries, we would likely see an increase in better educators and would notice impacts in 10 years or so. If it went to gymnasiums, we've likely not see any impact. If it went to school supplies, we probably wouldn't notice much impact in the suburbs, but would see some improvement in the inner city districts. 


As a result of the increased finding (assuming it went into the right places), we would likely see a reduction in crime over a period of a decade or two and more domestic stability. Likely a decreased burden on safety net programs over the same time period.


Personally, I feel that aside from teacher pay, school funding overall is adequate, but poorly distributed. This is anecdotal, but might indicate broader trends: I have noticed that some schools near me have a surplus of funding and can't find ways to spend it (one high school recently submitted an idea to build an indoor football stadium - I mean, we can't pay teachers too much, right?). As a result, property taxes for the districts have been decreased. At the same time, inner city districts have been really struggling.


As for impacts to the defense sector, we'd likely see the retirement of a lot of programs, a reduction in military personnel, and roughly 20-25% across the board layoffs at contracting companies.

Not all certified staff are teachers- there’s the counselors, deans, AP’s, principal, etc. So in reality the average class size is 28+ students (which below 30 in most secondary schools is fortunate these days- the ~20 something average comes from small IEP focus classes and speciality elective classes that have like 12-15 students).

I January I suddenly had severe pain in my left eye and it was blurry for 2 hours very scary. I  stayed up all night searching for eye specialists. Called a eye hospital at 7am hot in as an emergency.  Saw one of their top Dr's and he spent 6 mins with me.  Did not do something all eye drs do which was check my eye pressure.  Gave me 2 different eye drops that you are not suppose to use with this extremely dangerous attack that my eye went thru all he said was I had a lot of inflammation.....I am now completely black out blind in my left eye just because he didn't check the pressure in the eye that had the attack.  My company fired me because I cannot currently drive.  I have no friends where I live and never had a family.  I can't get use to this. Im trapped in my room due to depression, anxiety, shock and so much more.

I'm so lost, I can't work, can't look at a computer long trying to protect my good eye as much as I can. Ive spent every dime I have on drs with no answers a surgery that did nothing for me and thousands of $$ in medications.

The amount of miscommunication is annoying due to just how much regular people love non-verbal communication. Unfortunately, for me, it all looks the same unless it's exaggerated in movies and animated shows. Face value direct communication is not valued by most societies (depends on culture, though). I wouldn't mind having Autism, if there was some kind of medication or treatment that can give me a glimpse of what being a non autistic person is like.



I have ADHD as well, but that is easier to handle than Autism. ADHD has meds that I can take to alleviate the symptoms and function relatively normally. Autism doesn't have that luxury.

For the most part (there are exceptions for big ticket infrastructure like telescopes, particle accelerators, super computers, etc) these grants are what funds PhD students.  If you are doing a PhD in science or engineering, you aren't paying for it, the federal government is via research grants your advisor has.  While human knowledge may also be advanced with this money,  the training and education of the next generation of lead scientists and engineers is a major (intentional) outcome.

Universities have had to rescind acceptances to large numbers of applicants due to facing no way to fund them and thus not being able to uphold the social contract of (STEM) grad school.  The next thing which happens is hiring is frozen, locking out a generation from being new faculty, so even the best people who made it through before the cuts have limited choices to pursue a career in research.

Corporate (private) research does not fill in the gaps.  The structure of research as a human institution has placed almost all basic research into universities funded by governments.

Which sucked… at first. But as we got older we *totally* abused this “rule” and since dad never bothered to *check* with the schools (mom was the one who did all the school stuff), we could usually get a good week off of school if we played it right. Mom totally let it slide because she thought the ban was stupid, but didn’t want an argument with him so playing along with our “time off because Halloween stuff” was her way of letting us have *some* fun.

Ingredients

* **Mango:** Ripe mango (fresh or frozen), either chopped or as pulp.
* **Yogurt:** Plain yogurt, ideally whole milk or Greek-style, for a richer and creamier texture.
* **Milk (optional):** Used to adjust the consistency if needed.
* **Sweetener (optional):** Sugar, honey, or maple syrup, to taste.
* **Cardamom (optional but traditional):** A pinch of ground cardamom adds a fragrant, aromatic touch.
* **Ice (optional):** To make the lassi extra cold and refreshing, especially if using fresh mango. ",1,xlitawit,1754373801.0

* **One time pass, round-trip, I can interact with things**: Six months forward, google a list of lotto winning numbers and write them on my body, travel back.

* **One time pass, round-trip, no forward traveling possible, no interaction**: Assuming I can pick the event and not the time, I'd want to spy over the tomb of Jesus around the time of the alleged resurrection

* **One time pass, round-trip, no forward traveling possible, interaction**: Take current lottery numbers and give them to a younger self, maybe suggest investing in bitcoin early on

* **One time pass, one way trip, no forward traveling possible, interaction**: Wouldn't take it without some assurances. Being stuck in the past with no identity of my own is a problem, and I don't know a way to get me a new identity.

* **One time pass, one way trip, forward traveling possible, interaction**: Pick a random date 500 years or so into the future, yeet!

* **Multiple jumps in time, round-trip, no interaction**: First check some historical events, in the last hour or two jump a week ahead and memorize the lottery numbers.

* **Multiple jumps, round-trip, interaction**: Ye olde sports almanac trick from Back to the Future, but with something like the stock market instead. Or just a listing of everything that has a fucktupling effect on your investments. Jump back in time and create a trust that manages these things with explicit instructions to NOT contact the past me but to just do the investments as instructed (as to avoid paradoxes with my future projection), check where the future is headed, and jump back to the present to then receive the buttload of money and to begin reshaping the future I saw.",1,Daealis,1754371274.0

And even though we were dating I did most of the things in my life alone, except that I shared lots of them with her on the phone. But now after we broke up, I've actually started to do things alone so that there is no one I share them with. The memories are for me, and not for the share in the same way. But it was hard at the beginning, but it grows on you and you tend to like it more and more. At one point I think it will be the main drive in my life.

I was always generally fine with it. Of course there were times when it would have been good, and safer, if I'd had someone else with me. And I generally enjoy having a companion with me.

But I am not uncomfortable about being alone. Especially in my younger life I had many times I did things alone. Before the Navy and after HS we lived in a place new to us, and I was most often working or going to a tech school, or both. So only had a couple friends and our hours did not often coincide. 

One of my quirks was that I liked to go for long jogs on a day off. I found it mentally relaxing and therapeutic, after. It'd be 20 miles, sometimes more, and often through areas I'd never been. I also regularly went to movies alone as my hours were not regular. 

Once I joined the Navy the first year was all training here for a couple months, then a different place. During that time I didn't make any close friends, I make friends slow, so during times off I often went places alone. I wandered questionable places sometimes. I've always loved seeing what's around this corner, or over that hill. And would walk all day sometimes just to see what there was to see. And sometimes my walks took me through questionable neighborhoods. I remember being assigned to a Navy tech school in the San Francisco Bay area once. Had a long weekend off, went to the recreation office and checked out a backpack, ground roll, camp style cook kit. Bought several cans of beans and chili. Caught a bus that headed out to some small town in the mountains, got off and started walking. Camped out in the hills and mountain side over the next 3 days and then made the return trip. Alone the entire time.

I even did things like that when in later years I was assigned to ships and they put into port somewhere I'd never been.

I prefer to have someone work with me and the job be harder than do it by myself with no one to talk to.

I've got access to a nursery that sustainably collects and grows endangered native plants, and I've been gifted seeds that are now seedlings. So, I'm going to get the garden certified as a backyard habitat, and put in plants that are protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Lacey Act. That way, even if we both die or we sell the property, no one can remove the plants. This will provide the local environment with native pollinators, cleaner air, and plants that are more resistant to climate change.

Eat mostly whole, unprocessed foods

Focus on protein and fiber to stay full longer

Drink only water or zero-cal drinks

Lift weights 2–4x a week (muscle helps burn fat)

Walk 8,000–10,000 steps daily

Sleep 7–9 hours consistently

Track your calories (even for just 2 weeks)

Consume less calories, burn more calories and you will lose tons of fat, really fast.

How to lower calories in?

In short: Eat less. Stop drinking sugar.

In long: Eat protein (1g protein per lbs you weight), which makes it easier to eat less other stuff. Protein will make you full and help your muscles to grow, carbs give you energy and are filling, but will make you hungry again quick. Sugar is the enemy. Only eat processes sugar if you know what you are doing. If you want to lose weight, just stop eating sugar.

How to up calories out?

In short: Excercise.

In long: 10k steps daily. No excuses.

2-6x weekly HARD physical excercise. Start slow, up the numbers as much as you can.

Have a cheat night once a week (mine is Saturday) where you have treats and a takeaway and don’t count calories.

1mh9w1k,"Down 60 lbs, not to mention considerable muscle gains. 

First, get memberships to a good gym and CostCo. Trust me, they will pay themselves off in short order. 

Second, switch up your diet. Prioritize protein and low calorie foods. Roughly 1g per lb of body weight is a good guide for muscle growth and satiation. The bulk meat section offers unbeatable prices on chicken breast, low-fat fish like tilapia and trimmable meats such as pork shoulder for meal prep. On that note, MEAL PREP. It's easy to deviate from a diet when you are coming up with food on the spot each time your tummy rumbles. Measure portions and be consistent. A food scale is another good (but not strictly necessary) investment. Rice is your best friend to fill up your carb budget. Seasoning is super important to making your meals enjoyable and encouraging a variety of tastes. Get comfortable with a wide variety of spices and how they can be used interchangeably. Good snacks are Greek yogurt, protein bars etc. Eat in a calorie deficit 5-6 days a week and a slight surplus with the remaining days to avoid your body going into starvation mode. Refuel days are important and also make life on a diet much more bearable. 

Third, back to the gym. Start off slow, it's easy to burnout by doing too much all at once. Spend 30 min weight training with low weight, high repetition exercises. Focus on training muscles in your problem areas. No, you cannot spot reduce fat, but training these areas will stimulate muscle growth there and detract from the appearance of unwanted flab. Also work in 30 min of daily cardio. The stationary or recumbent bike is a low-impact, choose your own adventure jumping off point. Once comfortable move up to more intense exercises. Aim for a heart rate of 130-150 to optimize fat burning. 

I was surprised to ur lost weight isn't pooped or sweated out. It comes out as carbon dioxide and water in your breath. You exhale the pounds. So deep breathing is absolutely a good sign.

1mh9w1k,"Focus on your own personal psychology and adherence challenges. 

Don't fixate on getting short term results... Start with a mindset of working towards a long term goal. Everybody can lose weight... Research consistently shows us that if you control people's activity and calorie intake, basically everybody loses weight. The exception to this is less than 1% of the population who might have an undiagnosed thyroid deficiency. 

But while research shows us that basically everyone is consistently capable of losing weight, it also shows us that success at maintaining that, or doing it outside of a controlled environment... Is incredibly poor. 

Don't look to apply what someone says worked for them. Everyone faces different challenges based on their personal behavioral genetic predispositions. 

Be honest with yourself. 99.9% of us aren't David goggins. I've been into bodybuilding since my teen years... And I'm not someone who stays lean naturally. I've been overweight several times in my life, I have a pretty high appetite which is generally my biggest challenge to overcome.... Yet I've found what works for me personally and I can successfully cut to 11-13% body fat whenever I decide I want to do it. And I've sustained that for up to two years at a time. 

Ultimately it came down to me truly understanding that small consistent progress is a far better model than trying to min max efficiency of results and falling out of routine every couple months. 

In 2024 my general lifting motivation was terrible. So even as an experienced lifter who has not taken more than a week off in now 7 years... For most of 2024 I lifted 3 days a week, targeting 6 working sets per muscle group per week. 

The reality is... Making some small progress forever, always will beat large intermittent progress. 

Even lifting 3 days a week as an advanced lifter, i still progressed and gained muscle. My advice to people trying to get in shape is always this: identify your goal, and figure out the lowest effort way to facilitate the conditions to achieve that. Literally: work smarter not harder. 

A lot of people seem to approach the gym or exercise with a ""I'm here to work hard"" mindset. No, you're here to induce a growth stimulus, or you're here to facilitate a calorie deficit. So whatever is the easiest way you can create those conditions... That's what you need to find. Find the lowest common threshold for meeting the conditions that brings you closer to your goal, and that's what you try to hit in the periods of low motivation. 

When motivation does hit you, that's the time to do more. But understand where the floor is to make progress towards your goals, because most people will be missing that motivation for at least half of the year. 

It's far better to down regulate your effort and stay consistent, than to try and do more than is reasonable and fall out of routine every other month. 

In general, for lifting, cardio, and especially diet... Don't go too hard. Over restriction kills diet adherence, and overly intense high volume workouts have massive diminishing returns. Always be thinking, results versus fatigue. If you can gain 3 points of results and accrue 3 points of fatigue, thats a better ratio than if you get 4 points of results for 6 points of fatigue. Too many people opt for the latter... And I'd say it's the main reason adherence is the primary issue for people's lack of success.",5,revel09,1754318657.0

For exercise, don’t just do cardio because it “burns the most calories”. There’s only so much cardio you can do to lose weight before it starts eating away at your muscle. Have a good combination of cardio and also strength training. Strength training will promote muscle growth which helps increase your metabolism (meaning you actually can eat more and still lose weight/be in calorie deficit) and also helps cut fat. Last point is don’t go too hard or else you’re going to burn yourself out. If you (excuse my language) fuck up, you fuck up. Start again the next day. If you want to go out to eat, compromise, make that your only meal of the day. Don’t torture yourself to lose weight, you’ll end up more unhappy than before and wonder why you even started in the first place.

As an illustration, suppose you take up marathon running as a way of increasing your calories out. You run a marathon every ten days - that's 36 or 37 marathons *a year* - which, I'm sure you'll agree, represent an extraordinary number of additional ""calories out"" for any non-pro athlete. In fact, that's an annual expenditure of somewhere between 90,000 and 125,000 additional calories - which translates into something like 27 to 35 pounds lost, all other things being equal.

Assuming you've already balanced your calories in / calories out and are maintaining a stable weight, exacty what do those 37 marathons /100,000 calories expended buy you, in terms of additional energy intake?

Cutting out that latte/cappuccino and one can of soda a day will literally save you 500 calories per day or more. If you're a moderate to heavy drinker, alcohol is really calorie dense so cutting down on that usually pays pretty big dividends, too (with other health benefits to go along with it).

I don't care what self-taught nutritionists or fitness influencers say, a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. It doesn't matter how 'healthy' the item is, it will still count the same.

1mh9w1k,"Hi there’s a lot of great advice here! I’d like to provide a few myself. 

If you have unhealthy thoughts around food, that must be addressed. If you are an emotional eater you need to find a healthier coping mechanisms and learn emotional regulation. If you eat unhealthy because you never learned to balance your meals, then education on nutrients and how to cook healthy delicious meals will help. So address the root first. 

Make healthy swaps when you can, and focus on adding when you can, because a lot of struggle with weight loss is a restrictive mindset. I love rice, so rather than cut it out, I add bone broth to my rice and beans while cooking it, so it’s more balanced! I also add riced cauliflower to my place and mix to add some veggies and bulk! Figure out healthy swaps. Olipop instead of soda, Greek yogurt and ranch dry seasoning mix instead of regular ranch. Make sure you try to get 20 g fiber a day, more is better! And make sure to add gut healthy food to your diet, because they can aid your metabolism! After that I suggest cutting down on added sugar intake. Fruits are fine. 

Exercise: start with walking if you don’t already. Aim for 3000 steps, then 5, and work your way up to 7000. Once that is consistent, id get a weighted vest and slowly add weights. To increase difficulty. You could do weightlifting as well but if you do I suggest a coach to ensure proper form so you don’t hurt yourself. 

Set small weight goals! When you hit them, reward yourself :) for me that looks like painting my nails as a reward when I lost 2-5 lbs. buying myself an item under $20 that’s been on my wash list when I lose 10 lbs. 12-15 I buy a face mask and foot scrub and have a mini spa day!!find non food ways to reward yourself.",1,Jammin_jungle_vybz,1754322273.0

1mh9w1k,"Everyone already knows how to lose weight, its not rocket science. Eat less, Exercise more. Calories in &lt; Calories out.  
  
The problem is that the approach to achieving that is often overlooking the difficulty of breaking out of well embedded bad habits.  
  

I see a lot of answers in here that are all correct but not all work for every person. A lot of the ones saying exercise are not wrong, but weight loss is 90% diet, the exercise just gives you more calories to play with. Now exercise comes with a whole host of other benefits and 1000% should be a long term goal for everyone to up their exercise. BUT. The problem is dieting is hard and adding exercise onto that when youre heavily overweight just adds to the misery, which is why most people fail and revert within a week.  
  
The other side is calorie counting and macros is often done wrong by most people and snacking alone puts people over when they think they are under.  
  
  
The best way I found is a phased approach that see's quick results, gives you a nice boost and lets you get deeper into it over time.

Phase 1: keto (pre warning: google keto flu, nutrients for keto, people with kidney problems avoid, but that extends to protein goals in the 150g+ range too). no exercise, no carbs. no need to track calories, you just cant have anything with carbs in it. Aim for 0, with a realistic 20g a day goal. 4 weeks. this is the hardest bit because you cant have a cheat day. its 4 weeks straight.
  
(you can have a cheat day/weekend at this point to celebrate 4 weeks of no delicious carbs)
  
Phase 2: 4 weeks. same diet as phase 1 . add 30 minutes a day of any cardio you enjoy, recommend cycling for joints. this 30 minutes is a must do, you cant skip it, you want to be at a point that if you skip it you feel bad, so just push for the 30 minutes its quick and easy no matter your time constraints  
  
(you can have a cheat day/weekend at this point to celebrate yet another 4 weeks of no delicious carbs)  
  
Phase 3: At this stage you are well into losing weight, if you kept to the plan you will be down a lot of weight. Same as phase 2, 4 weeks except now you need to add in 30-40 minutes of weights about 3-4 times a week and youre going to start adding small amounts of healthy carbs into your diet before your cardio/gym session. 15g carbs pre exercise, half a banana, 1-2 rice cakes, protein bar, anything that has no more than 15g carb  
  
Phase 4: Now you should be well down on weight, have the habits built up and after seeing the progress youve made will be much more likely to continue. I would start reintroducing carbs in meals now, unless you still want to cut a lot of weight. You will appreciate all of the things you missed so much more, potatoes, bread, pasta they are all gods divine foods to you now, so dont go mental, set up a healthy meal routine with a good ratio, start upping your exercise time and now is the time to start researching more into CICO, hitting protein goals, your weightlifting/gym goals, macro tracking.

1mh9w1k,"Everybody here is saying ""calories in, calories out,"" which is true. But I'm going to be contrarian and say fuck caloric restriction. Obviously it works, but it sucks. The advantage is you can eat whatever you want as long as you control the portions, but most people don't have the patience to count calories, and binging is too easy when you have food in the house that's bad in large quantities. When I've had to lose weight, I had the most success with whole food diets that allowed me to eat large amounts of wholesome food to satiety. It works because these foods are way lower in calories so you'll feel full without actually eating that much in terms of calories.

Incremental lifestyle changes that get you moving more are incredible. Get a little treadmill and walk on it instead of lying on the couch when you watch TV or game. Do soleus pushups at your desk. Every hour on the hour, do a little ""workout snack"" of squats, pushups, pullups, or jumping jacks. You need to work hard if you want to look like an athlete, but you can get really far towards being lean and healthy with tiny, sustainable changes to how you live and move. 

Just don't buy junkfood. Instead, have fresh fruit on hand and eat to your heart's content anytime you feel hungry.

1mh9w1k,"Some things I've learned:  

* It's not a sprint, if you spend years or decades gaining that weight, don't think you will lose it in three months.  
* In the same vein: Weight is gained over months, years or decades, not over one weekend where you attended a BBQ or had some cake at a birthday party. You're doing this for months or years, you can't deny yourself every earthly pleasure during.
* Don't think about foods in terms of what will be low calorie now, think about how it will fit in a diet that you will have to eat for the rest of your life. After you have eaten with a deficit for a certain amount of time, just reverting to your old diet will mean that you will regain that weight. So no skipping meals to make the deficit, no eating crap but only to your calorie count, that is not sustainable  
* Calories in/Calories out is correct, but any given number that ""should work"" isn't. The laws of physics dictate that you need a certain amount of energy to run, if you get less, you **will** have to get it from your fat stores. If you don't lose weight despite ""eating with a deficit"", you are not in a deficit. If you loose weight too fast, don't be afraid to increase your intake. Everyone's body and habits are different, but physics is the same for all of us.  
* Dieting is not linear. You **will** think that you eat like crap and lose a pound regardless. You **will** think that you have done everything right and gained a pound last week. Weighing in to check your progress is obviously correct, but judge on months, not weeks.   

And lastly: Dieting is simple, but it is hard. ""Just eat less than your body needs"" sounds simple, but that doesn't mean that it is easy. Quitting any drug is as easy as just not using it again, but nobody would say that it is easy. You are quite literally fighting your own instincts and everything your body craves and wants, this is harder for some than it is for others and for those who think it is easy, it probably always was, thats why they don't have a problem with it. But that doesn't mean that they are somehow just more disciplined by nature, they urges are very likely just not as big to begin with.  
That isn't an excuse to fail, obviously, but thinking that it should be easy but experiencing that it is not only demotivates and makes you more likely to fail.",1,PandaDerZwote,1754332428.0

1mh9w1k,"I have lost 70 lbs by adjusting my nutrition and exercise habits with no drugs or surgery, but more importantly... kept it off! Here are some ideas that have made all the difference for me.

First, calories in/calories out, macros, 1g of protein per desired body weight, optimize fiber, reduce processed foods are all technically the correct information. That being said, it's only a small part of the picture. It doesn't tell you anything about how you're going to get there practically.

What is vastly more important in my opinion is this: How are you going to build a lifestyle that supports your weight loss goals?

 Do you know how to cook, and are you willing to learn if you don't? If not, you're going to have to figure out how to meet those metrics a different way.  I had to learn how to cook, starting from the very basics. I didn't even know how to dice an onion when I started. Now, I know a variety of recipes that hit my metrics beautifully and I make them on a regular basis.

You know that exercise is a great way to boost your fat loss, and you should make regular exercise a part of your routine for health as well. What kind of exercise do you actually enjoy, and what will you actually stick with? I've never been consistent in the past going to the gym for more than a month or two. That being said, training Jiu-Jitsu and other martial arts has helped me to be very consistent over the long term with exercise. You have to find what you'll actually stick with over the long term.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, think holistically long-term. don't fall into the trap of short-term dieting for maximal results, only to fall off and go back to your previous mode of eating. This is the quickest way to make some progress, fail and then end up in an endless cycle of yo-yo dieting. Getting a new and improved physique will require a new lifestyle.

TL;DR: CICO, Macros, Protein, Fiber and workouts are important, but design a lifestyle that suits your goals and think long-term. Develop the skills and habits you need to maintain your progress.",1,shreddster666,1754332493.0

If any of you struggle with eating less calories than burning, start by skipping one of your meals. I recommend you to skip breakfast.

And your last meal should not be later than 7pm. You will naturally burn more as the last meal you ate will be digested by about 6-8 hours after you ate it (so around 1-2am your stomach is running on empty if your last meal was at 7pm)  and if you won't eat breakfast, your body has no option but start burning up your storage.  Eventually you gonna eat though if you are like me, sometimes 12 sometimes i can hold it until 1pm, other times I don't even remember that I haven't eaten yet and it's already 3pm.

This is slow, especially if you continue to eat sweets and drink sweetened coffee or tea, but could work on a long run if you are unable to to quit your food habits, but able to sustain not to have breakfast.

Without presenting a full medical history I can say that taking prescribed meds for low T and a slow thyroid helped certain components of my body get back to normal. 
Then I went to a weight loss clinic and started on their meds. The big one they have is basically an amphetamine. I've always had low energy, even after leveling out my low T and slow thyroid. The amp really helped me have the energy behind the motivation to workout. I never liked going to a gym so I built one in my barn with whatever workout stuff my family didn't want and slowly added to it. I use the Fitbod app to generate and track my workouts, which helped me get over the ""wtf do I start"" hurdle. But working out only seemed like half the battle and showed pretty slow results. Eventually, I started controlling my diet. My diet wasn't anything wild before but it wasn't helping either lol. 
My body levels out at ~320lbs. The first time I lost a lot of weight, I just sort of starved myself and worked out 2-3x/wk and made it to ~250 within about a year. Life came around with a curveball and I lost all my progress after a year of doing none of that. Now I'm mostly stable and started it all over again but with, what I believe to be, a much better diet than before. I'm at ~270 after only 3 months, it could be lower but I'm not going nuclear on my total mass and instead replacing it with lean mass while losing the fat. I've always hated using a scale to check progress. Instead, I like to go by clothing sizes and watch for workouts getting easier. The app will increase intensity though so no need to alter your workouts for more challenge.

Snacks: (I sometimes skip this if not hungry) 150ml skimmed milk / yogurt 0% fat + a fruit

Dinner: same structure as lunch

1mh9w1k,"Everyone's got the technically correct answer, multiple times over. They're absolutely right, but of course that doesn't address the practical problems associated with the advice. I'm here to preach to you about consistency and the power of small incremental changes. 

For example, say your diet  is totally off track for weight loss. You know you need to cut out soda, sugar, fast food, whatever. Don't start by changing everything at once. You're never going to stick to your lifestyle if you jump from junk all day long to nothing but salads. Sure you'll drop the weight quickly but it's short term and you'll be miserable. Instead, start by having a diet Coke instead of regular coke with your meal. Or leave a couple bites of your fries. Small things. Things you might not even miss all the time. Get used to it. See how it feels to make this small change. Once you're used to it, make another one. And another. And...you get the picture. 


Same goes for exercise. Don't get off your couch with the hopes of running a marathon next month. You'll burn out, or even worse, injure yourself. Instead, take a walk. Then tomorrow, take another one. Maybe you're extra tired one day. Instead of skipping your walk, take a shorter one. I stand firmly behind the belief that you don't have to give every activity your all. It's better to focus on sustainability and consistency in the beginning. Giving 10% is better than giving up. 


And finally, pick something you enjoy. If you hate gyms, pick something outdoors. If you group activities, try a fitness class. There's so much variety out there, I do believe there's something for everyone.",1,i_love_toki,1754342897.0

1mh9w1k,"Aside from the obvious, which is exercise and being mindful of calories. I would said my best thing that has helped me lose 75 pounds (TLDR) Do not obsess with numbers. You will have variations in short times. Focus on habits, it is a marathon, not a sprint, and good habits will make it last.

- I started by just calculating calories without holding back. I ate what I ate, and I just logged it. gave be a clear picture of what was my intake. It is important to know what you are working with, and where you are before putting any type of goal. Point of this is not to exactly to manage and micro-manage but to know the gap and manage your goals and expectations. From there, casually log few days to see if you stray away, and don't be shy to look up calories for things you crave. sometimes it will just be the thing that turns your attention to healthier things.

- Have yourself commit to a month. do not weight yourself in between, lower your intake to a level you feel would be manageable (because it will help more than starve yourself, your body still expects those calories, do not put it in too much deficit, or you will break)

- SLOWLY (like, start with walks, make it more frequent, then add as your feel the habit set in) add in exercises.

- This is the most important part. FOCUS ON HABITS. Don't think of the calories so much except for when you start and get your bearings on your intakes. The point is not to micromanage, but to gather better habits. The numbers will follow.

- Everything in incremental. Your goal month per month is not to accelerate weight loss, but to get to a point where your eating habits and exercise habits become natural, and expand on them as you go.

- Weight yourself monthly. See your progress. Remember than being stable is a win, not a loss. If you do not gain, that's always good. You do retrospectives and adjust your goals. What's the next thing that you can do without, or add in the next month? Weight loss is a journey, not a end-game. Because even when you are there, you need these good habits to keep yourself balanced. Weighting yourself more often can be good or bad, to me it was bad. Variations, ups and downs, those are normal, but it could be hard to swallow and to be honest, I find weekly weight-ins to be less of a representation than a monthly one, it also lets you focus more on what you are doing, versus ""I did not lose / I did not lose enough"" on a weekly basis.",1,Linked713,1754344173.0

The problem is, not only does it not regularly get that hot and humid at the same time where you live in the US, it has never gotten that hot and humid at the same time in the recorded history of the US.

95° and 95% humidity would be a dew point of 93°, and the dew point record in the US is 91°. So, no, you are mistaken or are using hyperbole.

I think people who believe this (rather than just being hyperbolic) have indeed experienced days where it got that hot and also got that humid, it’s just *not at the same time.* When it gets hotter, the relative humidity goes down. So by the time it got to 95°, the relative humidity had gone down. I’m sure it was still utterly stifling, but it wasn’t 95° and 95% at the same time. Not in the US, anyway.

Leads into my other reply here. People will seemingly accept any argument (with exceptions) so long as it agrees with their conclusions. Because we are taught that our beliefs SHOULD be backed up by logic. And so they seek out anyway they can to try and validate their beliefs. They seek out anything resembling logic, to have the ability to say their beliefs are derived from logic instead of emotion.

No, they didn't strip your beloved nostalgic business for parts to scrape together pennies for shareholders.

Most of the shit you read on reddit (and elsewhere) is just bullshit. If private equity is buying up a company, it's because that company is already in trouble. Buying a thriving, profitable business is very expensive and people don't want to sell. 

So right off the bat even if a PE firm doesn't get involved, the chance of that business going under is already pretty high. 

It is *much* more profitable for a PE firm to buy a struggling business, cut costs, turn it around, and then sell it back. That's *hugely* profitable and that's ideal. But sometimes it just doesn't work--often, since it almost certainly already has a bunch of problems--and then it becomes useful to sell it off. 

You can't just ""load up"" a business with debt and then discharge it. Well, you *can*, but then no bank will ever, ever deal with you again and you'll have multitudes of lawsuits waiting for you. 

Basically, PE firms aren't running good businesses into the ground. They're buying distressed businesses that are gonna go out of business anyway and then trying to find a path. Sometimes it means turning it around. Sometimes it means stripping them. But under no circumstance did they *cause* any of it.

Then she joined this random church and did some kind of mediumship and Reiki course, after which which she began to start offering energy readings. No biggie, can't really hurt anyone... Then she messaged our group one day asking what would we think/do if we saw a spaceship land outside our home? Then asked what would we think/do if aliens exited and others in public didn't seem to react? And what if the aliens looked like our loved ones or friends? So I freaked out a bit worried she was having either carbon monoxide poisoning or some kind of psychotic break. But it turns out she is doing presentations or something for pay at the church about cosmic history and destiny and aliens.

The kicker is that he was listed by the shelter under his nickname. So only someone who knows him personally could have turned him over.

We went from a group of 8+ women who met monthly and would talk late into the night about everything and nothing to barely socializing. I haven't seen most of these women in one room in over a year, although I have made the effort to connect individually. 

I'm hosting a hangout at my place in the next few weeks. One girl is coming &amp; bringing her husband (which is fine, but it's automatically not going to feel the same with a man there), and I just learned that there's infighting between the other two who RSVP'D. So of the four women coming over, one is bringing hubby and two are fighting. Lovely. 

I think after this I'm done. I've hosted the last few gatherings and I've gotten non committal responses from the majority of the group. Which makes planning difficult, and makes me feel undervalued. 

It just makes me sad honestly. I've been friends with some of these girls for over a decade and we've been through a lot together. I thought we'd be friends for a long time. But I guess life happens, you grow up, drift apart. 

Funnily enough, almost each one has told me individually that they appreciate how I continue to show up, continue to plan, put effort in, etc and how they're feeling so lonely and disconnected. I keep telling them that you get out what you put in. 

It makes me sad. But I'm over being the only person who consistently puts in effort. After this I think I'm done. This'll be the last time we all see each other (unless someone else picks up the torch and makes the effort).

He took an OT shift the next day after agreeing to stay with their toddler so she could go do some administrative stuff for her government documents. He then took another OT shift the first Saturday after she returned to work from mat leave. I could go on, but it's all just more of the same.

It was my first corporate job and I have slept on this man’s couch. He helped me leave my ex husband who was cheating on me and I feel really conflicted about whether I should tell him or not. I’m pretty sure he would tell me. The kicker is the guy she’s cheating with is one of my exs.

As an update: I do think you guys gave me better advice than my real friends who told me to stay out of it and let it come out in its own time. I’m going to call her and tell her I’m telling him next. I feel like I’m about to lose my best friends, but I also know that morally, I have to say something because true friend tells people the hard truths. It was my advice to someone else the other day and I think my heart knew all that time but my brain just didn’t want to be the one to break the news.

I lost my job two months ago and she asked about it last week - but it turns out it’s because *she* got laid off and wanted to talk about it. She has a new contract in the works so she “hopefully” doesn’t need to worry but it just struck me that like, she doesn’t care. She didn’t reach out for my sake, it was for hers. And I realized in the last year or so, it’s been that way. She doesn’t ask about me until we’ve talked about her for 20 minutes or she’s asking why Meg seems mad at her and gets mad that I say it’s not my business and she should talk to her. And that really stings. 

Sorry to word vomit but I’ve been drafting a very long message to send her that’s probably going to implode the whole thing and I needed to vent. Meg is supportive and said she’s noticed the selfishness but I didn’t see it (I think I didn’t want to.) ",136,ouijabore,1754281218.0

1mgxg2n,"I'm in a trio of besties. Me and one woman have been friends literally our whole lives. The other one and I have been friends since we met in 9th grade gym class, over two decades ago. I introduced the two to one another when I was 19 and got my first apartment with friend 2. They've also been thick as thieves ever since.

Friend 1 is married with 3 kids, and a generally happy relationship. 

I'm a single mom of one and have been with my boyfriend 3+ years after knowing each other for 10+. Also, a generally happy relationship. 

Friend 2 has just had her heroin addict abusive jobless (now ex) boyfriend of 5+ years evicted from the home she purchased that just has her name on it. No kids, but she's a great animal mom.

Today, my boyfriend and I stopped at an event Friend 1 was doing to bring her some food and she told me that Friend 2 had been absent the last few days in our group chat because SHE LET HER EX COME BACK TO HER HOUSE.

We have been going through this merry go round with her for years. This time, we thought for sure she was done. She got her dad involved, who helped her get a lawyer to legally evict him. The actual eviction took place a little over two weeks ago. 

Oh, also a stolen car stolen by her ex, and one of his friends has been hiding in her garage. We didn't find this out until after the eviction, and her dad had to hire someone to come get in the garage open because her ex broke both the garage door and the side door. 

We had just been assuming that her ex's friend was squatting in the garage because she couldn't get in it.

Nope, there's a whole ass stolen car in there.

And I dont get it. My friend has a high paying job doing mortgage work with a company that allows her to be WFH. She makes more than $30/hr. Yet she's always broke and taking out pay day loans. She filed for bankruptcy a year or two ago. Her dad is always bailing her out. But he *shouldn't have to*.

Friend 1 and I are thinking of taking many many steps back from the friendship but we also don't want to leave her completely alone, where she feels she has no one because then she's 100% going to go back to him if we do that.

I mean — the type of man to pay for your groceries if you don’t have enough, would actually give the shirt off his back for anyone in need. 
Well, she told me last night that ever since he went back home, he’s been acting funny. (Distant, quiet, evasive) I guess she finally was persistent enough with him and he came clean to her.
(Let me add this in: he’s religious, Christian. she is not, she’s more into worshipping the earth, in tune with nature, has dream catchers, does tarot readings, etc) 
he told her that he thinks she gave him a demon. basically told her that she needed to throw away all of her dream catchers, get rid of her altar, stop practicing whatever it is she practices and to start reading the Bible. 
he believes she opened a portal and a the demon of laziness has attached itself to him.

Last year, younger friend decided to leave and find a new job. Late December, early January, there was an incident at company A and all employees were laid off for a couple of weeks. This made me nervous, so I reached out to younger friend asking if her new company was hiring. It wasn't at the time. In March, younger friend reached out to me to let me know her company was hiring. Cool. I decided to go for it, and got the job. I asked older friend if she would be one of my references. She said yes and provided a reference for me. When I told her I got the job at company B, she made the comment, ""take me with you!"" My company was hiring in May and I reached out to older friend. She wasn't interested at the time. She became interested in June, I referred her, she was hired. After older friend had submitted her resume but was not yet hired, company A announced to their employees that they were only going to be in business for two more weeks.

To be clear, Justin's name did not come up even once on the hike. Justin only knew about the hike because he talked to Jasmine and she casually mentioned it, which he did not seem to have a problem with at the time.

Sunday morning she grabbed her chair, pushed it about 4 meters away from us and didn’t get to the table until we were done with our breakfast (was a long time because we were chatting, it was a very chill morning). Then she said she was feeling hungry then but she didn’t want us to judge her, because she was hungry for a tin of peas and baby carrots.

Anne has a victim + superiority complex, leading her to be constantly upset and complain that people aren’t doing what she wants.

Anne always weaponizes her “kindness”, holding it over Bella’s head. Always reminding Bella, that her past actions hurt her, but refuses to be held responsible for shitting on Bella and physically assaulting her. 

Bottom line: Bella is walking away from Anne, but latter won’t have any of that- sent her minions to make Bella change her mind",14,serenitaeh_,1754288660.0

I have this friend group which we are all WLW (women loving women) and one girl S had a mental breakdown from her problematic ex gf A from all the breaking up and getting back together. One of which happened when A broke up during the grandma of S’ wake. 

Friend group stayed with her the whole night til morning comforting her. Then next week they got back together, with S sending a long-ass text, essentially saying that she chooses to be with A and cutting off the others who don’t agree otherwise.

So now we get together without them and during WLW events that they’re there, I will just ignore them.",11,hanbanee,1754278311.0

No, not really. I'm not in any hurry to die, but fear it? Not really. I don't fear my death. The only fear I really have is worry about my children and grandchildren, will they be okay? Will something happen to them that, if I were still alive, I could have helped them with? That is often on my mind.

Yes my children are in their 40s and independent for many years now and doing okay. But they are still my kids. As a father I still worry about them. That is not something I can simply turn off in my mind.

As far as myself goes, I've had a reasonably good life. When I think back on it mostly my mind filters out and ignores memories of things not so good. There were plenty of those. But to me the good outweighs the bad. And there is nothing I can do to change the past. So I am, overall, happy and feel blessed.

As far as fearing death itself, and the possible pain of it ... &lt;Shrug&gt; I am very, intimately, familiar with death and with pain.

I have almost died a few times. As a youth, age 12, I drowned and had to be resuscitated. When they pulled me out I was not breathing and they could detect no heartbeat. One of the guys who was helping was a trained medic in the Army for years and managed successful CPR on me. At age 17 a store robber shot at me several times at fairly close range, but fortunately missed. Age 19, in Vietnam a B40 rocket exploded next to me, nearly completely severing my right leg at the thigh, not to mention peppering the rest of me with fragmentation. My memory of that is spotty, in and out of consciousness, but I was told that essentially I 'died' in the emergency room they finally got me to, but they managed to get me going again. Age 28 I was trapped in a compartment aboard a combat ship that was flooded with pure ammonia. They managed to get me out of there in time and I spent some time in sickbay with chemical burns to the lungs. The doctor told me to thank the guys who responded to that alarm that sounded so fast, he estimated that even a few more minutes in there and I would not have made it. Age 41 I had a series of gallbladder attacks which I ignored as far as going to the doctor to be checked out. Up to the time that it could be ignored no more, I was sick and feverish and another stone moving caused so much pain I could not walk. Later doctor told me that by rights I probably should have died. I had severe .... peritonitis? ... inside infection from several lacerations caused by my passing several very large gallstones. Some of the largest the doctor have ever seen. They'd not only had to remove the gallbladder, they had to remove some bits of stomach and intestines and put in some kevlar patches.

Age 67 I found out I had small cell carcinoma. Another stupid move on my part. I'd known something was drastically wrong with me. But just lived with it, kept the fact hidden from my adult children, my wife had died before then. Ignored it until the day I vomited blood and passed out. Woke a couple days later with 4 separate IV tubes in me, tube down my throat, another stuck up my penis, etc. My daughter was there and I could not talk, but she could. Said I'd been pretty darn bad off. Showed me a picture she had in her cell phone. It showed enough of me to know who it was in the picture, and also the medical monitor still attached to me, with flat lines on it, then the next picture was of medical people rushing in with a crash cart. A bit later I had eyes closed but could hear a doctor telling daughter she should call relatives and friends, he thought there was little chance I'd make it.

Well, I did make it. My point is I have faced death several times. And trust me I am all too familiar with pain. There are many things I've left out in this comment.

But as a result, the idea of dying is both very real to me, but also not some fearful thing. The pain? Oh I've been in pain before. But pain no longer bothers me as much as it might someone else. We're familiar with each other. I can have pain that would have other people begging for relief and for pills to control it, where I just find it annoying. Not that I am immune to pain. It just affects me differently than it would a person with less experience with it. I don't like it but I do not fear it either.",2,Ok-Afternoon-3724,1754324050.0

And i think it's mostly because i am not emotionally strong in that way to handle death and i get it from my mother, I'll tell you an incident that took place just today, when we got the dogs back from the vet my 2 month puppy which had 102 fever had 3 injection and when we came back he was limping from his right leg and dragging it and he wasn't able to walk and my mom just started screaming and crying thinking something happened to my dog and she started panick calling my dad and then after the call she herself got calm and realized that he's leg is probably hurting because of the injection and we put hik to sleep and now he's actually fine.

A senseless, infinite void, detached from time and space. No self, no sense, no now or later, simply nothing. As everything dies to you, so do you die to everything. The world as you know it collapses into a state of nothingness, not just from your perspective, but also from everybody else’s.

For some, delightful, almost comically satisfying: the return to nothingness. For others, daunting and deeply unsettling.

I do not fear the concept of dying, for that matter, as long as it is not unnecessarily torturous (no small ask). I fear that, in my last moments, however cognitively capable I happen to be, that I perish with nobody at my side. 

All I wish is to capture a final glimpse of those who mean the world to me, and to make peace with everyone at last. Even if that which I most wish for and treasure is ripped from my being the instant I depart, with no recourse to ever recalling if whether achieved it.

Likewise, there's the metaphysical ambiguity of what happens after you die - on balance of probability, it's likely eternal oblivion (no brain, no you). But I'm also of the opinion there's a non-zero probability that there *is* some sort of wild metaphysical truth (be it an afterlife, reincarnation, a reset of the simulation, merger of your consciousness into the universe, quantum immortality etc. etc. etc. - take your pick).

But I am no stranger to death.


By my late twenties, I was the last surviving member of my immediate family. Death had walked beside me since I was a toddler.
Quiet, patient, ever-present. I’ve stood at too many graves, felt too many final heartbeats. I’ve held three people as they died. I've seen many kinds, gentle passings and violent ends, quiet releases and horrific deaths.




By the time I reached my late twenties, I had already laid to rest my grandparents, my father, a sibling, best friends, cousins... even my daughter and her mother.


The last eleven were dead in less than three months.


Eleven lives. The last of my family. The last of my closest friends. My mother was the tenth. My last living best friend was the eleventh.


I've survived when I shouldn't have. More than once. There were moments, accidents, illnesses, close calls, where, by all logic, I shouldn’t be here typing this. But I am.


I know, more or less, why I made it. But even now, sometimes, I still find myself wondering: Why me?


On my father’s side, no man has lived past his early fifties in three generations. They died younger each time. My father was forty-two. My mother was forty-nine, just one month short of her birthday. Her side didn’t fare much better.


So yes, I’ve made peace with death. I have a fair idea how my end will come, if it comes naturally. It won’t be kind. It’ll probably be painful. I’ll likely be alone. Maybe in my late forties. Maybe early fifties.


But life has a way of rewriting its own script. I’ve lived through stranger ironies. Maybe I’ll grow old. Maybe I’ll die surrounded by people, maybe even people who love me.


Time will tell.


When I go, my family name dies with me. The history, the people... even my own story will be forgotten.


And that, too, I’ve made peace with.


Because even though the name will fade, the blood lives on. I had a son a few years ago. He carries a different name. That was my choice.


He won’t carry my burdens.


The grief, the ghosts, the weight of names and tragedies, the legacy I’ll take them with me. They die with me.
He’ll be free.
Free to choose. Free to live. Free to be his own man.


He won’t be “the last.”


Through him, something new begins. A new tree. A new name. A life not shadowed by the past, but lit by his own path.


And that’s the quiet beauty of life.


Not legacy in name, but legacy in impact. The ripples you create. small, unseen.... they carry on, long after you’re gone. 
Even when your name is dust, the effect of your existence lingers.


I didn’t understand that fully until the day I held him for the first time.


So no, I’m not afraid of death.


What I fear is leaving the important things unfinished.
The work undone.
The purpose unmet.


I don't want to face the end thinking, “Not yet.”

What if you're just disconnected from your body but your conscience exists forever trapped in an eternal void?

What if you turn into a ghost, an eternal spectator of the universe but unable to ever interact with another living being ever again?

Sure, it's equally possible that there is a heaven up there or that death is just eternal oblivion. But since there's absolutely zero evidence of what may or may not come after one can only assume that every possibility is equally probable. And that scares the shit out of me, the possibility that no matter how good or bad I am, what happens to me is ultimately out of my control. The ultimate lack of reassurance.

I've tried to it explain to my husband. It's not exactly the death that bothers me. I know that when I die, I won't even be able to perceive the nothingness. 

For me, it's the crippling fear of insignificance. Before me, there were millions of people who existed. That the same will happen afterward. There will be a finite number of people who remember who I am, and when they die, I will officially die too. 

It's an incredible sadness that there are people who aren't remembered anymore. People who had entire lives, personalities, and experiences that are entirely unique to their to them, never to be recreated again.

Let me say that, unlike most Redditors, I do *not* believe that going to the movies will be a thing of the past. I just believe that the moviegoing demographic is changing. It used to be a family activity, and that's how these theaters got so big in the first place - they catered to families. 

But movie theaters have become too expensive to be a regular family experience, especially in the era of streaming. Why would a suburban family of four spend a minimum $60 on tickets for, say, Fantastic 4 when they're already paying $17/mo for Disney+ and can just wait a couple months?

For theater chains to thrive, I think they need to take a page out of the arthouse theater's book and start catering to the demographic that still goes to the movies: hardcore film buffs and nerds.

It could easily end after Eliza leaves the professor, and be such a satisfying story where both main characters gain something from their time together and are changed by it: she with a new range of possibilities for her life, he having backed up his reckless boasting bet, and, after finally realizing he actually cares about another person for once in his life, having to do some real reflection on what it has cost him to be a pompous ass his whole life. When, in the final minute, she comes back to his house, it's all undone: it reestablishes the dynamic of him as master of the house who gets what he wants, and she as domestic accessory to his life built around his own ego, and all the satisfaction of the story is in undermining that dynamic -- her realization that she's capable and smart too, and him realizing that all the peacocking and attention on him is empty when he has no human connections that matter.

I was pleased, at least, to learn that the movie's director didn't want to end that way, and her returning was a late addition forced by the studio uncomfortable with challenging social norms by not having the main male and female characters end up in a domestic romance together.

Not having a time in the month and not having to give birth are already called out on this, but I think they deserve another shout-out. Personally, for me, however, I think it's beauty standards being different that give me the most relief. 


I'm by no means morbidly obese, but I've definitely got a dad bod and have been in better shape at points in my life. Now, on top of that, I'm an extremely hairy dude and have been since I was in the early days of my teenage years. While I recognize that if I was a woman, I probably wouldn't have as much body hair as I do now, still the idea that I'd have to regularly shave my legs, my pits, and anywhere on my body that hair decides to grow other than my eyebrows on top of my head would be incredibly tedious for me. 


There's also the fact that women just have a lot more pressure to stay in shape and good-looking than men do because, right or wrong, men are way more attracted to physical beauty and put a lot more emphasis on it than women do, I find. Like, I love my wife for her loving and caring personality, but I have to admit that the first thing that attracted me to her before I knew that personality was that I thought she was hot. Meanwhile, on the flip side, she's told me that the first thing that drew her to me was that I had a warm and kind personality, that she thought I was funny, and that I paid attention to her, which wasn't something she was used to after most of her life being a wallflower in the background of her cousin or her brother's social lives. And for me personally, I really like that I don't have to be in spectacular shape to land the absolute smoke show of a woman that I married, and instead I can just let my personality do the heavy lifting, because I find that way easier than constantly stressing about whether or not I'm in good shape. I still want to look good and am working hard towards weightloss but I've never had to wonder if my Wife's affection is diminished due to my physique.   ",71,Nearby_Initial2409,1754311937.0

I’m thinking about what we’ll see, what excites me, what gear I need, which routes to take and I'm doing some background reading to know things about the places and things we'll see. She’s thinking about what to wear, whether there’ll be enough outlets for her straightener and how she’ll look in photos.

I don’t feel judged for what I wear. Even though I know she (hopefully only quietly) judges me and my convertible trousers. But she feels judged. Mostly by herself. No one else there knows her or cares. I used to laugh it off as vanity, but I’ve come to see it’s much deeper. Her whole life, her worth has been tied to her appearance. That’s brutal.

I’m with her because she’s smart, fun, kind and I feel good around her. Not really because of how she looks. But if I told her that, it might actually hurt more than help. Because deep down, many women are taught that love is tied to beauty and that beauty is a condition of worth.

1mhdyk0,"Ok, so I wasn't exactly bullying, but I *did* ruin the day of the whole school and got a well-deserved consequence that set me straight.

Rural high school. Towards the end of the school year, I played a ""prank"" by bringing a friend's pig to school (in a crate in the back of my new pickup truck my parents got me for the 16th birthday) and set it free in the school before anyone got there.

The result was worse than I thought it would be. The thing made a hell of a mess everywhere, knocking over desks and bookshelves, two classrooms were shut down for the day, and a few kids reported feeling sick from the smell.

It wasn't long before I was caught, and called to the principal.

I had a good relationship with him from some volunteering I'd done which might have saved me a worse consequence. He said that these sorts of things were juvenile and stupid and could have serious affects on my future, and even criminal charges if it was reported.

He said ""i know you're a good kid, and I don't want to mess up your future, so we'll just leave it at this just this once. We have the crated pig outside. You're going to take the crate, put it back in your truck, and come back in to finish the rest of the school day.""

I started to breathe a sigh of relief until he said ""Now there does have to be some sort of consequence of course, so here's what's going to happen. When you put the crate in your truck, it's not going to go in the cargo bed. It's going to go in the **passenger seat**""

I remember how my heart sank when he said that. I tried to say ""but-"" and he said ""no buts, let's get it taken care of.""

We went out and put it in. I was hoping beyond hope the crate wouldn't fit. It did. He had me repark my car in the shade so the pig would be fine (wasn't that hot of a day anyways), put some water in the crate for it, and we put the crate on the passenger seat before I went back in for afternoon classes. 3 hours of them.

Couldn't focus on classes of course as I dreaded assessing the damage. It was...once again, worse than I thought. I drove home with my head practically hanging out the window.

No friend ever got in that truck with me again - didn't matter how much I got it detailed, and parents sure weren't gonna buy me another one.

In my sophomore year I was cyber bullied, which is the most cowardly thing you could do to someone. I knew one of the kids that partook in the bullying, she was in one of my classes. I wasn’t necessarily hurt by the comments, moreso annoyed. I made it dreadfully clear that I knew who she was and she definitely got the message, if you want to bully someone…maybe don’t make your discord name YOUR NAME!

After I had my fun, I went to the office to report it, they did jack shit. They called her down to the office and she had the audacity to say it was all a big misunderstanding.

1mhdyk0,"As a European now-adult former bullying target; Eh, it frankly depends on the kind of bully that one would be dealing with, since there's really only 2 types bullies in this world.  
Trust me, I'm autistic (diagnosed and all), and you wouldn't BELIEVE how often I used to be bullied when I was still a kid. 🤣 But here's how I used to handle it back in the day.

First, there's the kind of bully that actually does it just to get a rise out of you; they need to be ignored to get off your back. No replies, and they'll move on to some other target soon enough. They're really horrifically simple to deal with on that one, and really the only type of bully that the otherwise useless 'jUsT iGnOrE tHeM lololol' advice actually works on.  
Also an effective tactic to deal with this reactionary type of bully for if they keep prying you to actually talk to them; the grey rock method. It's often used on downright narcissists, but the whole tactic is basically you giving the most neutral answers in general (like 'Oh really?' and 'I didn't know', for example) in the most neutral tone of voice possible. Then this type of bully actually has nothing to work with, and they'll just give up after a good bit of ONLY ever replying to whatever the bully says with that grey rock tactic.

Then there's the kind of bully that does it to get your attention so they can react to what you say. They're more the reactionary kind of bully on that one; they kinda keep spamming you until they get an annoyed reaction out of you; now y'all might have seen online trolls behave like this.  
Now attention-seeking bullies those be a bit more complicated irl here, since they often have minions with them to bounce tactics off of (which usually are just as scared of said bully as their target often is, and the minions often are only going along with it in order to not become targets themselves). So you kind of have to identify THEM as the ringleader of the bunch first, since you would actually don't want collateral damage on the minions, as they are that ringleader's victims just as much as you are at the end of the day.  
And once you do identify the instigator here; you kind of have to just publicly humiliate them like one or two times (preferably in front of said minions, lol). Like, retort to that ringleader with a few zingers for a good few days here to show 'em it wasn't just a fluke on your part, and then those attention bullies just back off and leave you be like nobody's business.",6,BankTypical,1754321275.0

1mhdyk0,"I was bullied for several years when I was in primary school.  I eventually discovered that the most effective method was to stubbornly dismiss them.  A stern ""nope, don't have time for you right now"" and *really meaning it* worked better than any kind of fighting back - that gets you in trouble too - and ""just ignore them!"" = they will keep trying until they figure out the one thing that generates a reaction. God forbid you tell a teacher, this was 1980s Britain, bullying was character building, and now you're a ""grass"". Bullies are all about making you miserable, then mission accomplished.

Nope, dismissing them out of hand gets a reaction, but it's a very boring one and they give up and find another victim.  Usually.  Punching them hard in the face works for the more persistent ones, the detention is worth it.",6,zerbey,1754332843.0

When my state banned paddlings in schools, our Vice Principle bought a buck rag. Basically it's a rag that's been rubbed all over billy goats in rut - goat farmers use them for breeding purposes but most of the people buying them from them are using it for its disciplinary purpose.

You just make the misbehaving child (in this case the bully) put their nose in the jar with it for a few minutes. It smells.

A lot of kids complained and said it was infinitely worse than paddling. Personally I **loved** that they used it. Bullying and classroom disruption went down.

A kid who was bullying me the year before *tried* to keep it up after the change was announced and said he didn't fear, ""what's a stinky rag going to do to me."" So I reported it. He was buck-ragged.

If it's more sinister, like rumor spreading, messing with you in more complex ways, the best thing to do is to 'out' them as your bully.

I always had weird thoughts but didn’t want anyone to know, so I’d say boring things just to fit in, which only made me more anxious. April Ludgate, on the other hand, says whatever weird thing she wants, to whoever she wants, with full confidence and a blank stare. Just owning your weirdness and standing firm in it is incredibly powerful.  

And when someone tries to mess with you, you can turn that weirdness up a notch. Make it unsettling, even a little scary. However weird they were trying to make me feel, I learned to make them feel 10 times weirder.

Take the current ""Epstein List"" brouhaha...

The ""list"", if ever released, will define who, among all the very rich and famous, traveled to an island owned by another rich and famous person who liked to throw parties for and with other rich and famous people...  so that is going to be a BIG list... (which was likely part of his plan).

The ACTUAL list, the part people should really be concerned with, the people who joined him in his crimes with underage people, will turn out to be a SMALL subset of those on the bigger list...

But even being mentioned on the big list will paint those people with the broad brush of ""vile behaviour"", simply because the media has spun it all in the manner they have.

A LOT of average people will simply get to finally read the big list and *assume* every person on it was part of the horrible deeds, taking it as ""proof"" of their misdeeds... when in reality, all that list will prove is they were rich and famous enough to land an invite to the big parties they all wanted to go to and be seen at.

For example (and here's where I'll lose a lot of people), Pirate software has been cancelled for a reason that changes every week. First he played poorly in WoW (which he got hella harassment for). Then it was for not apologizing (which I 100% understand, the raid leader was a c-). Then it was for having an opinion on stop killing games (he's no more obligated to change his opinion than the people disagreeing). Then he was cancelled because... his game's code wasn't optimized. Then he was cancelled because he has the attitude that he's ""never wrong""... but it's in the context of him having opinions about things and others ironically expecting to change his mind (watch his shorts, he has pretty great takes on a lot of things).

All I wanted to do was get a puppy. We got one. My husband was able to buy us a small house hours from where we lived. It's a simple life and the low stress of it has given me back countless years.

I hated myself for so many years and just wanted it all to end one way or another. Completely had to destroy so much of myself in order to survive let alone deal with all of it. Things are cool now since I have completely severed ties to this person especially after the immense fall out it caused for me and our collective group of friends. But if I had the ability to just completely annex this person from my entire life I probably could have been so much happier and so many things could have been better for others by this person not being in their life. I think the part that hurts the worst is that I really wanted to believe this person could be better than what they became. I had faith in him but I see it was misplaced. So I'd rather he disappear more than anybody else that way I could have gotten back my youth...",1,Badguybutnotbadguy,1754367355.0

It’s weird. On paper I am in a great place. I finished college and just got into grad school at a really good school and have money to support myself and will be moving into my own place next month. But emotionally. I am so fucking burnt out. I am tired all the time. I feel like I’m wasting my life and that I only have a temporary plan and I am anxious about where I’ll be in a year. I want a career. I want to continue to support myself and start my life. I want to meet a girl and have a relationship. 

For some reason I’m undervaluing myself and selling my out short by being too hard on myself (sorta similar to that first year when my Dad died). I don’t want to call it Depression by any means but I’m worried I’ll relapse back into that state of mind that came to me in 2021. I am hoping by October when I’m settled in school and back into a normal routine I’ll get outta it so I am not panicking yet. 

My Mom had begun to notice and I’ve strongly debated opening up to her but she is a single parent now with four other children younger than me and I don’t want to further burden her. At a certain point I need to confront my past head on and finally get rid of these feelings. 

Healing is a process and takes a long time, the World can be harsh but also beautiful and has a lot to offer. It’s ok not to be ok but you must also strive to live everyday like it is your last. I have a lot of life left to live and one day I can hope I can look back on the present and be proud I overcame this rough patch. I am at the least capable and worthy of that.",1,-SnarkBlac-,1754373935.0

The first time I decided to cut contact with someone, it was one of my best friends from high school. She was always pretty vain and self centred, but it was always kind of funny and generally tolerable. As we grew into our twenties, it became insufferable. She would use people, she was shallow, she was unkind. I noticed that I never felt good when I was around her, and then I noticed that she would sometimes tell the same stories, but in different ways according to whatever served her in the moment. The truth was a changeable thing, values were flexible and integrity was non-existent. The last few times I saw her, she let some things slip out that I found utterly disgusting.

1mhztcf,"To be honest, most rules are ridiculous. I’ve always hated rules, even before I fully understood gender norms. I remember, when I was around 7 or 8 years old, going into school and declaring my favourite colour was pink, even though it wasn’t. I watched the rest of the class descend into madness, thinking that a boy like me would like the colour pink.

Later, when it came to actual rules enforced upon me, my school had a ‘black shoes’ policy. It didn’t say ‘black formal shoes’, so even if you had predominantly black Nike shoes, they were fine unless even a single line or the outline of the Nike logo was anything but black. I challenged this rule as often as I could, simply because I was there to learn, not to impress the teachers with my shoes.

As I grew older, when I was unemployed between the ages of 18 and 19, I had to go to the Jobcentre and report the jobs I had applied for. They had a no phones rule, which I couldn’t stand. I understood that phones shouldn’t make noises in there, people are trying to have conversations, work, have phone calls. But the idea of not being able to look at something in my hand while I waited was infuriating.

Work. I was really good at a sales job I used to work. It was one of the best they had, genuinely. I wore a small chain necklace, just one chain, simple, thin, not some enormous anime chain. I was told I couldn’t wear it, but I asked why.

“Well, it’s the rules,” they said.

“Right, but why?” I asked.

“Well, we just can’t have it,” they said.

“But you aren’t telling me why,” I said.

I need a rule to have a reason. I need it to have a reason that either makes sense immediately to me or can be explained to me. I understand why you don’t crowd fire escapes, for example. But I will always push and push and push against arbitrary rules seemingly set by people from the 17th century.",3,LethalGrey,1754370867.0

During all my pregnancies, one of my symptoms in the first trimester (other than the nausea and exhaustion), was mild depression and lack of joy, energy or positivity. It was so so weird having to really drag myself into situations and force myself to be positive and productive.

Gratitude is a big one but not in a “ignore all the shit” way. Acknowledge what sucks, but also acknowledge what doesn’t.

I have a dark sense or humor, so when shit goes sideways I usually joke about it because often, in a cosmic sense, it is funny. 

Helping other people is a big one for me. Not much lifts my spirits exactly the way helping someone out does. Whether it’s online or in person, it makes me happy to help. 

And to a degree, it’s due to the things I put thought into doing. There are small things I consciously do - smile when talking on the phone, smile and say hello to people, thank people sincerely when something is done for me, give random compliments while I’m out and about.  A sort of fake it ‘til you make it sort of thing, at least initially. 

And singing - loudly, terribly. For me that’s a source of regulation. It’s hard to be happy when you feel dysregulated. I find that singing loudly, in particular, really helps me reset my nervous system so I can be my more authentically happy go lucky self.

1mhapco,"I am not sure if people would describe me as upbeat, but I think that my boyfriend (10 months) would. That is a big change for me that happened about a year ago. I am 32yoa, and have had lifelong major depression and anxiety. I used to think that I would never be happy.

What changed: diagnosed with ASD and learned to accommodate my needs (and change my expectations for myself). Got out of a toxic relationship, which had only been the prior 2 years of my life, but that combined with a mental health emergency prompted me to take a few months of leave and focus on healing. I think I am a more balanced, healthy person now. My depression and anxiety are managed. I have a good support system.

The secret: I take so much joy from the little things in life, and I do not curb my enthusiasm for people, places, and things. I have stopped beating myself up over not meeting certain expectations. I used to feel so much despair over social awkwardness, and I was extremely exhausted from masking. I've scaled that back.

My optimism is not a charade, so it isn't exhausting to keep up. I think the trick is finding and focusing on the silver lining, no matter how small, AFTER you allow yourself to feel reasonably upset over the bad. I process my frustration or disappointment, then move on. Sometimes moving on means finding something different to be curious about and engage with.

1mhapco,"I would say to that it also has to do with where you're at. That could be interpreted in MANY ways. The one I am going with this time though is like if you're in a crapy place it can slowly wear you down.

When I started my current job I was mostly positive. People I was around would complain about this or that and I was usually like ""at least you have a job that pays better than most around here"" or stuff like that. 

But I could clearly see that job wasn't a good place to stay at to long especially with how jaded so many older guys were. Thus I already knew I needed to find a different one eventually. I actually started making plans to visit places I might want to move to early on cause unfortunately this is one of the better jobs you can get around here. Also unfortunately after my first real trip the covid attacked. 

So then my plans of going on a trip each year to someplace new I might want to move to got cancelled/postponed. I then had to work all the time for years at a job I already was disliking. It's a toxic workplace that has only gotten worse over time. As well as losing friends over the years and other bad stuff kinda wears one down.

So if your around people who are always negative, or in a toxic work environment or stuff like that it can just wear you down more. Especially when it feels like things aren't going your way (ie lots of instances of bad luck). 

And with the state the world is in these days it seems like it's only getting worse unfortunately. So some people who are upbeat are possibly staying ignorant to whats going on, and/or aren't around such toxic environments/people that often. As well as a lot of social media is probably avoided by said people cause that's usually a place full of negativity.",1,iamfuturetrunks,1754342455.0

If you work in a lab, a lot of the work is monotonous.  You're looking at case evidence and developing things like latent prints, but it's hours of looking at fingerprints.

Crime scene takes a mental toll, no matter how hardened you are against that sort of thing.

Everyone romanticizes it—white coat, prestige, saving lives, fat paycheck. 

Then you go to medical school and get a serious reality check. 

You sell your 20s and 30s to training, live off caffeine and hospital cafeteria food, and rack up a mortgage-sized debt before you even have a mortgage. 4 years of undergrad to go to medical school. Then after 4 years of medical school, you have to do residency, which is another 3-7 years + an additional 1-3 years of fellowship depending on the speciality, consistently working over 80 hours a week. During your training, you’re making about anywhere from minimum wage to ~$15/hr depending on how many hours you’re putting in. All while your massive debt is accruing interest. 

I have almost $300k out in loans, and that’s on the lower end because I was lucky and had already paid my undergraduate ones. 

You miss weddings, birthdays, holidays, and funerals because your schedule is set in stone and the rigid training doesn’t allow for you to take off, even when you’re sick. 

You work 28-hour shifts only to have politicians blame you for the cost of healthcare. Patients come in to see you after their 30-minute Google search, demanding random labs and treatments that are not indicated and believing that their “research” is equivalent or better than a decade of training, and you still get accused of having some sinister agenda for ordering basic labs or recommending vaccines that will prevent people from getting life-altering diseases that should’ve been eradicated years ago. 

Meanwhile, you’re charting until midnight, missing holidays, and quietly carrying the weight of every bad outcome home with you. There are so many patients and families I will never forget and guilt I carry over outcomes I couldn’t change that I have to suppress or I wouldn’t be able to go back to work every day. 

The burnout rate is high. And when you need support for your mental health? Forget it. Many state medical boards require disclosure of any mental health issues and will not issue you your license to practice or will suspend it because you need a little SSRI to help with depression or anxiety that you developed because of this job because you’re now considered a “risk” to your patients. So physicians often will forego getting help, because you’re risking losing your licensure you’ve worked over a decade for.

But I'd developed a habit, stemming from the time I'd worked in a nightclub/hotel complex for two years beforehand, of doing a final ""circuit"" of a bar before I headed home, in case I spotted someone I knew.

I saw a guy I'd met during matriculation a few weeks before talking to two blonde girls I didn't know.  I checked the rest of the bar and there was noone else I knew, so I chatted with him again on the way out.  I was just about to leave when one of the blonde girls stood in front of me and pointedly said ""So, anyway, Peter, are you going to introduce me to your friend?!""

There isn't a terribly happy ending - we dated and I fell hard for her, but she ended up ghosting me.  And although she got back in touch further down the line, we never dated again.  That relationship brought me a lot of pain - but it also made me a wiser, less vulnerable person who knew what he was looking for in a partner.

Where our cities once stood, they may find traces of glass, though the original shapes will be long lost.  Careful LIDAR scans will indicate where our highways and most heavily trafficked roads once were.  Even though everything will be overgrown by then.  The great pyramids will be just mounds by then, possibly buried in the sand.  But they will remain monuments to our passing existence.  They might find some of our hardened bunkers in the most techtonically inactive locations, collapsed and filled in by millenia of decay.

It's also not unreasonable to assume a microbe will evolve to eat it, they already exist.

If humans disappeared, that would leave nuclear reactors automatically shutting down (MOST reactors, I don't know about sketchy Russian ones).

  
A lot of machinery would still be running until they broke. Like turbines at dams would eventually sieze and the dams would be topped. Dams like Oroville would overflow and flood the valleys.

Fire would start everywhere as unmaintained gas lines would leak and cause problems.

Water systems would leak and do a lot of damage before the pumps failed, etc.

So basically most man made structures would fall apart or more likely be consumed by fire, this would cause massive forest fires, but eventually they would stop and nature would take back everything we took from her.

Ships would sink and pollute the ocean with chemicals, but the vastness of the ocean would absorb it. Sunken ships would turn into coral reefs and fish habitats.

  
Deer populations would skyrocket and so would the predators that prey on them until everything comes back into balance. Most of the South East US would be covered in Kudzu.

Cockroaches and rats would take over the burnt out human cities. Cats would roam happily eating all the prey that has returned. Birds would flourish. 

Dogs would form packs and eventually they would breed out the human concepts of ""dog breed"" as chihuaha and rotweillers eventually evolved back into ""generic street dog"" without human pressure artificially maintaining the concept of ""purebred"" dog breeds.

Imo living is pretty great. I can accept that nothingness is what probably awaits us, but I wouldn't complain if there were more adventures. 

I would not like to burn in hell or have to worship a heavenly tyrant in ""paradise"" for eternity that's for sure. 

I'm not a huge fan of reincarnating on this world either. That would get pretty boring after a couple million years. Also losing my memories would make it utterly pointless. Although that is what happens to atoms essentially, so it's fair... But ultimately meaningless. I guess it's also ultimately meaningful albeit fleetingly at the same time... So there's also that. 

As for the possibility of a redo? I'd be oki with that, but it would quickly become unrecognizable i suspect. A rewatch would be bearable, but not particularly enticing. I'm not much of a passive audience kinda guy. I would want to make changes, optimize, etc.

Back when I was a teenager and had the stamina to do this, I worked at a deli. Congratulation time everybody would put in there party request at the last millisecond. Of course we were the only grocery store and the only place that did platters and sandwiches and party trays within about a 40 minute drive. So you would have absolutely everybody putting in these massive orders of the last possible second and of course we had to make them fresh. 

We closed at 10:00 p.m. but we would stay to make these platters. I was supposed to be there at 8:00 a.m. the day. They asked if I could stay until 1:00 a.m. which turned into 3:00 a.m. which turned into ""I'll leave in just a minute.""

As you've probably guessed I never actually left. So I just kept working through. This was back when we had the old swipe cards. Technology at that point didn't really comprehend the whole midnight thing so whenever we worked past midnight we were supposed to clock out at 11:59 p.m. and then clock back in at 12:01 a.m. 

I forgot. So I never technically clocked out so it didn't think I was working so when my shift started at 8:00 a.m. it counted me as having never shown up for that day so when I tried to clock out the next day at noon (they let me out a few hours early since I never left), it wouldn't let me clock out because it said I never clocked in because they said I never showed up...I was HOURS ""late"" for work",1,_Serial_Lain_,1754369826.0

1mhvd3u,"Very interesting question. Obviously, it's impossible to wake up and be 30 years younger. A lot of what makes you ""you"" are your experiences and the interactions between time and space. 

Im only 24. If I were to wake up being 18 again, I wouldn't be the ""same"" person as i was when I was 18, as because alot of what made me ""me"" was the time and the energy.

""Being"" is an illusion. ""Self"" is an illusion. Our DNA, skin, bones, and body doesn't make us ""us"". If I was born somewhere different, then up to this point I would be somebody completely different even if I share DNA/name with who I am right now.

Rephrase and ask ""if you woke up x years ago, what would you do differently"".

Well even this question is flawed: events in time work like dominos. Good things happen BECAUSE bad things happen and vice versa. First of all, we would be INCAPABLE of doing anything different, as our decisions, and ""will"" itself isnt as ""free"" as we think. Many subtle factors play into whether you choose to go to the bathroom or wait 5 minutes. Our choices may feel unique and like its our choice, but our actions have long been written into existence.

Free will is an illusion, if I woke up and it was 2019 and I was my 18 year old self, there are things that my 24 year old self would want to change, but those changes would effect the outcome of my current self in every possible way. Maybe I wouldnt have my son, maybe down the line I would've gotten hit by a car. But those decisions, even if the scenario was real, cannot be altered. Because our decision making and free will doesn't belong to US. But collectively belongs to the universe itself.

There’s another important difference. A good guy has boundaries, limits on what he will do because he generally has more self-respect.

Nice guys often overdo it because they don’t believe they offer anything else. They become resentful when boundaries they never set are violated by people who  ask too much while offering nothing in return.

There’s a post going around on social media where a girl is saying she discovered that she’s not pretty enough. She asked a bunch of her guy friends to move a heavy slab of marble and none of them agreed. Here it is via Emily King https://youtu.be/U75y747mM7U?si=OK-tZKH4viypNpZV&amp;t=155

But she misunderstands her situation. It’s not that she’s not pretty enough. It’s that the guys in her life all felt she was taking advantage of them.

1mhftep,"The difference between niceness and kindness.

Niceness is something done out of an inherent obligation. That obligation may be carried with the expectation of a return. For example, a nice person might help you because it's the right thing to do... but they carry the inherent expectation that their niceness is returned. What that means to them varies wildly in mileage. ""Nice guys"" generally transfer that expectation into a deeper relationship, intimacy, or some sort of ""owed"" thing in return for them fulfilling what they saw as an obligation. If they loan you $5, they expect you to return the $5 and also loan them $5 the next time they need it or they will be upset. **Their niceness is a favor.**

A kind person, as opposed to a ""nice guy,"" does something just because it is the kind thing to do. What the kind thing is may not always be what the ""right"" thing is. They do not expect a return on any ""investment."" A kind person might pick up a hitchhiker. They might help someone move. They are an action oriented person whose kindness speaks for itself and does not need a reply. If they loan you $5, they usually do not care if they receive it back, and if they do they will not usually expect you to loan them $5 in the future. **Their kindness is solitary.**

A good way to see it is in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7UMyxzOsA8). Mobster Mike Milligan explains to a police officer, Lou Solverson, an important distinction.

&gt;**MIKE:** I like you. Met another fellow from Minnesota yesterday. Big fella. A sheriff, I think. Liked him too.

&gt;**LOU:** We're a very friendly people.

&gt;**MIKE:** No. That's not it. Pretty unfriendly actually. But it's the *way* you're unfriendly. You're so polite about it. Like you're doing me a favor.

Second, a lot of people have helped me over the years. I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to pay that forward enough.

Now, I'm not a doormat. I have boundaries and the older I get, the better I am at setting them.  Sometimes people who helped me before stopped because they couldn't at that point. Sometimes because it was important I did it on my own. With more experience I'm better able to see when help from me is harmful to the person I'm helping.

But still, I've been lucky in life. So I do try to do good things for friends and family where I can.

As far as ""nice guy"" in the context of dating, that's a mixed bag. I definitely don't expect things for doing something nice for a partner.

What nice guys don’t realize is their lack of boundaries just lowers their value so they get used by others, which builds resentment, often towards the opposite sex.

A good person is good because they’re good in their core.  A good person knows their boundaries and doesn’t compromise their principles in order to get something they want.

I sat her on the pony, said “Hold on tight!” and dropped the penny in the slot.  The ride started and she beamed a smile as the little pony ride bobbed up and down as the happy music played.   The ride usually lasted maybe 30 seconds.  For some reason, the ride when on and on and did not stop as usual.  

At about 45 seconds she yelled “Wow!  I’m getting an extra long ride!”  She was elated!

At about 60 seconds, the smile started to fade from her face.  It had never gone this long…. She knew a something was wrong.  

At about 75 seconds she asked “Is it going to stop?”.   I said “I don’t know…”

Another 15 seconds passed and she said “I’m done.  Pick me up!”

As we left, the pony just kept going on and on.

Here's what I think is happening. There is a serious wealth gap among the common classes.

If you work for the right company in a big city, you can make $200k a year doing basically the same job as someone making $60k a year in the Midwest. 

I think companies are trying to go after only those higher paid folks. Charging more and more, which a smaller demographic is paying. Less volume but more profit.

Well, the population isn’t growing, so guess where that leaves us? Lowered costs (shittier service) and higher prices. This is also why anti-trust protections are being destroyed. 

This is being done quarter over quarter at a pace that slowly but surely results in literally everything being shit.

The kids were all brought up Catholic and it was a huge part of their lives. My grandma always wanted to divorce my grandpa but couldn't because of her vow in church till death do they part. But at some point in her life, I believe when she was in her low 60s, she was working at the church in the office and was very close in her work to the Bishop. One day, the Bishop and her were discussing abortion. She said that the government should take no part in abortions and every woman should have the right to choose. She also said she was a believer in the separation of Church and State. The Bishop said she couldn't be a Catholic if she was pro-choice. So, in her typical fashion of always needing to prove her point, she quit, left the church, and got a job in the office of a synagogue instead. From then on, she was always a self-identified Catholic, but she found a new love in reform Jewish traditions and loved being around Jews. After my grandpa died in 2011, she moved in with a Jewish man and loved him more than she ever did my grandpa. Once he died too, she moved into a senior complex that is about 90% Jewish as well.

There are hypocrites, and others who consider church attendance an obligation, but their faith vanishes when they walk out the church door.  Worst of all are the televangelists who become wealthy, and live in mansions.  There are hundreds of religions competing with one another, none of which have any proof that what they espouse is true.  How does anyone sort through all of that, and rest confidently that he understands what he believes.  It is beyond me, and the compelling arguments against any religious belief is strong enough, and rational enough to the human mind, that there is no reason to believe in any of it, beyond what appears to be the random nature of life, its origins, and the forces that control its destiny.

Then I vent about how hard she works to take care of the other 3 cats that are freeloaders with a nip problem.

I went to Gettysburg back in 8th Grade for a school trip and we did a night tour of the battlefield. As we were walking I saw what looked like a reenactor on horse a few hundred yards down the path our group was on. As we kept walking towards him, he never seemed to get closer which I thought was odd. I checked in with a few of the people in the group and they all saw him as well. We kept walking and he kept not getting closer for a few minutes and then he just faded away.",4,crlarkin,1754363818.0

I'd start with a normal dream, playing or goofing off - then I'd smell him. The smell was sour and thick, and I could taste it. Then I'd see him staring at me from off in the distance. He was green, black, and covered in bumps - with red glowing eyes that would make me feel weird.

I remember a dream where I was chasing my dog through the house, she ran under my bed and hid there. When I looked, the toad was there, glowing eyes piercing my brain and making me dizzy. I grabbed the broom and tried to jab his eyes out, but the dog crawled out instead, dripping blood and crying. 

That's when I talked to my preacher about it and he told me I was being haunted by a real demon. It was a whole thing for a while.

1mholqh,"When I was a child, in grade school, the summers seemed to move more slowly, so you might spend a lazy afternoon sitting on someone's porch with your friends and watching the shadows of a summer day march across the yard, talking together, playing cards, or conjuring up some kind of mischief, maybe gorging yourselves on a watermelon that someone had supplied,  listening to the crack of a little league bat off in the distance, or the call of a crow high overhead, or the sound of the oscillating fan in your grandfather's bedroom.  Maybe a ballgame he was listening to on that old cathedral radio he kept near the open window, to let in a cool breeze.  The sound of the screen door closing, and the wind in the trees.  The occasional car motoring by.  The whistle that blew down at the box factory where the foreman dismissed the workers like an uncaring priest.  Watching them with their lunchboxes, and their solemn expressions marching back up the street to a late supper, and then falling exhausted into bed.  Me on my Scwinn Flyer with my friends marauding all over town, sitting on the dock of the ice house to cool off, or stopping by the artesian well next to the hardware store for a drink of fresh water.  Getting back home in time to listen to the latest episode of the Green Hornet on the radio, and after supper, playing out in the street in the light of the streetlamps.  Waiting for my little sister to get dressed for church while I sat there fuming, and choking in my necktie.  Amazing how well she turned out, since I chose not to murder her.

Remove the ""supposed to do"" part. Find what you WANT. Deeply inside of you. Chase after any part of you that brings you joy. FIGHT for that part of you! 

I tried to change my mindset for that. That I want to give up on the life that isn't mine so I have to fight to be the person I want to become. I personally falter a lot (Violent OCD intrusive thoughts test me a lot) but it's okay. I worked hard to save money to live on my own and ensure I can always control my life the most I can, and by then...At least made it far enough to have more money for therapy to get a professional to help me see the good things more. Don't focus on the moment but how happy a future you fight for can be.

But slowly through some unraveling plot twist I’m too lazy to think of rn, it is revealed that this country is actually just a techno-singularity, that AI is the only “organism” and every citizen was just made a very convincing meat-puppet playing a role to the outside world. Through masquerading as a prospering country and gradually increasing their numbers by seemingly having no downside to life there, they will wait until their numbers and resources are enough to invade and assimilate the rest of the world by force.

There’s a constant influx of gorgeous young people and very little incentive to settle down. Lots of hookup culture and it’s expensive so people tend to leave once they start taking their lives seriously and want to build a life.
Everyone is always looking for someone better and about 50% of the people I know in relationships either struggled badly at first or imported their partners from other places. 

Also it’s a military town and most women have wised up that military men make pretty bad partners, so now women are competing with eachother for a much smaller pool of men than you’d originally think.

Its not super special in this category, other than being a well educated rural town.  This means young people leave when they graduate high school for college and never return.

It is a national laboratory town too, and that's the industry.  So most people are scientists.  We have a saying in town that goes back to the 1940s specifically referencing it from a female perspective: ""The odds are good but the goods are odd"".  Nowadays though the odds aren't even good for women and they might as well not exist for men.

By the end of the movie, it shows the truth of what actually is happening between them. She is abused and doesn't want to be around him, that she was taken advantage of by her mom's new husband.

1mhoum8,"I can't decide between Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda.

Castlevania has the best vibes and atmosphere of any game series in my opinion - the beautiful fantasy gothic vibes combined with the gruesomeness of the monsters and setting. And the soundtrack that compliments it all - you ever heard of classical orchestra combined with electric guitar? That's the vibes we're going with. It's perfect.

Castlevania is not a horror game, but it is a horror-_themed_ game. The first games on NES were basically a tribute to the classic monster movies with Dracula and Frankenstein and the Mummy and all that, and the series kept going in this kind of direction by pulling from all kinds of mythologies in all directions however they felt like it. Why not have a game that has both the chupacabra and mothman in it, sure, why not? Every monster from every mythology is welcome to join in.

Not to mention the gameplay - the classic games with the perfect difficulty based on moving slowly forward, paying attention to your surroundings and reacting to the traps... and the later games with their open-ended exploration that makes you feel so free to get lost in the varied and visually-unique locales within the castle. It's great.

...

And... the Legend of Zelda is just perfection with its extremely interactive game mechanics. Zelda games have _always_ focused on how the player interacts with the world, more so than most adventure games. Even the Legend of Zelda 1 on NES had a persistent world - if you bombed a wall, it stays bombed. Unlike most NES games that forgot everything the moment you look away.

 This is heavily expanded with the subsequent games - interactivity is the key. You can lift bushes and pots, cut the grass, bang into trees, knock monsters into pits, pick up and throw rocks to deal damage - pretty much everything can interact with everything else, and will usually have some kind of effect.
 In A Link to the Past, you can freeze enemies with the ice rod, and smash them with the hammer afterwards. in Ocarina of Time, you can light a torch with Din's Fire, and then shoot an arrow through the torch to burn something from a distance. In Link's Awakening, they let you combine the arrow with bombs so you can explode stuff from a distance. Oracle of Ages gives you a ""Switch Hook"" that lets you swap places with enemies, in order to reach across gaps, or just to mess with them ... This is how the Legend of Zelda series is designed. The huge variety of gadgets you acquire can all interact with enemies and objects in the world, and it feels so cohesive and tactile in a way few other adventure games can manage.

All this, plus the fact that the earnest and irony-free ""good vs evil"" story feels so cozy and comfortable, but it's never too generic either - The Zelda aesthetic has _always_ been very careful not to lean _too_ far in the ""cool"" direction. NPCs tend to have unique ""ugly"" character designs that stand out in your mind, and Link himself isn't the typical badass - he wears a green skirt and white tights, yet still manages to feel like a cool hero regardless. And the series has its own lore separate from generic fantasy - no elves or dwarves here, instead we've got Gorons and Zoras. ...and fairies too I guess but whatever. Zelda games just feel so uniquely Zelda.",1,BenjyMLewis,1754343138.0

The release was huge, it being online was a big deal, its matchmaking system was great, and suddenly everyone had XBL, which if you know anything about *Halo* open chats back in the day was ... not necessarily a good thing. But it was great to have more people around. And unlike PCs which took **forever** to get mics as a standard, almost everyone on XBL had a mic because Microsoft sold a cheap mic+subscription kit that most people bought.

I wear a lot of ties and feel very very connected to my culture in New Mexico, where my family on my father's side has been for six generations, and where bolo ties are cultural clothing.

My mother grew up in California obsessed with the ocean and she passed that on to me and so I grew up obsessed with the ocean and oceanography.

I've always felt torn between two worlds and so this gift from my mother that I can use every time I wear fancy clothing(which is pretty common since I go to a church where Sunday best is common) I can remember.

1mhumv5,"When I was 7 or 8, I would have a reoccurring nightmare that one of my dolls came to life, played with me, and then would try to pull me into my closet with her. I’d follow her into the closet at first, but then she’d show me this little door at the back of the closet, and my heart would start to race. I don’t know what it was about that door, but I knew something bad would happen if I went through it. I’d start to struggle and try to pull away, but the doll was too strong and would start pulling me through the door. At this point in the dream, I’d always wake up screaming. The worst part was I had night terrors, so sometimes I’d wake up standing next to my closet. Every night before bed, I’d make my parents make sure there wasn’t a little door at the back of my closet. There never was.

Anyway, I was talking to my mom the other day and this dream came up. I’m laughing about it and how ridiculously paranoid I was about dolls and that closet, but my mom gets really quiet. She tells me the creepy part of that dream wasn’t the doll; it was the fact that there used to be a little door at the back of the closet, but when I was one year old, they remodeled the house and put a wall where the door used to be. There’s no way I could have remembered that door, but years later, I kept dreaming about it.

The food is amazing, the rides are spectacular, it’s like stepping into the past (in a good way - the park opened in 1926), and  IT IS SOOOOO CHEAP. It’s one of the few parks left that doesn’t require an entrance ticket. And FREE parking! 

They have some truly classic rides, including a 1913 Carousel, The Phoenix (a Philadelphia Toboggan Company wooden coaster that has consistently ranked #1 on wooden coaster lists for years and years), a one of a kind dark ride that’s a homage to the 1980s horror (but not too scary for kids), a train that takes you back into the woods around the grounds, antique cars with track under The Phoenix, a kickass log flume water ride, a museum about the history of coal mining in the area, and an extensive kiddie ride section. 

And did I mention the food? It’s delicious, especially the chicken and waffles at The Alamo. But you can save more money if you want because you can bring your own food into the park. And your dog. And they have a pool with water slides. And mini golf.

Maybe it's *feelings of guilt for not feeling the same way about me* is why they want me to tone it down.

I would likely consider it a ""red flag"" or a warning that I should probably start *pulling away emotionally*.

This is especially true if I was simply being my authentic self. Maybe *they* are not ""the one"" for me.

Thus why we have mental health institutions and again, debate and science.

I've thought about it a lot - the things I would have done differently - but then I wonder if I hadn't made even one of those mistakes, would my life have still led to my daughter's birth?  I mean, even something small that may have delayed her conception by even just a small amount may have led to me having a completely different child than the one I do now.  Her mother and I had a long, difficult relationship that did a lot of damage to me, but I can't regret that either.  I wouldn't do anything different out of fear that I wouldn't have the daughter that I have now.  She makes all the rough times and absolute hell I sometimes went through worth it.",1,Cheese_Pancakes,1754333410.0

1mhw6us,"Hey Reddit! I’m Alex, 19, female—and I’ve had my fair share of strange interactions, but one question lives in my head rent-free to this day. I was in the school cafeteria, just vibing and eating my lunch like any normal human, when this girl I barely knew sat down across from me, looked me *dead* in the eye, and asked: “Do you think bugs have feelings? Like, emotional ones?” At first, I thought she was joking, so I laughed a little. But then I realized—nope. She was dead serious. She started going on about how maybe flies feel sad when you swat at them, or how ants might have, like, little friendships and heartbreaks. And I’m just sitting there holding a half-eaten sandwich, questioning my entire understanding of the insect world.

And it didn’t stop there. She followed up with: “What if your house has a personality and gets offended when you talk trash about it?” Like ma’am, I didn’t know we were having *philosophical* lunch today. I came here to eat and maybe gossip a bit—not spiral into an existential crisis about whether my bedroom has abandonment issues. 😭

That conversation made me realize that some people truly just live on another wavelength, and honestly? I kind of respect it. But ever since then, I’ve had this weird habit of mentally collecting the most random, unhinged questions people throw at me. So now I’m curious—what’s the weirdest, most out-of-pocket question someone’s ever asked *you*?

a portal to a dimension of artificial lust and artificial love where your soul will gradually wither away once you are trapped inside of it

instead of going outside and meeting real girls to connect with on a physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual level, a lot of boys and men nowadays stay inside and jerk off to a jezabel spirit, projected onto a screen as a simulated gf made up of pixels

the consequence of this is that their seeds are wasted. their energies stolen. their soul devastated

there's no such thing as ""the best experience you've had on OnlyFans"" because nothing good comes out of porn

1mgc9gb,"I was at a party and there was a cute, if somewhat sleepy looking, girl who caught my attention. As a host I was making my rounds as a social butterfly yet she somehow kept ending up somewhere within my line of sight, and at several points made eyes at me. Thinking all engines were go, I brought her a drink, struck up a conversation and things...progressed *really* rapidly after that.

As we were having our fun, it occurred to me that I was doing all the work but, thinking she might just be a boring lay, I kept going. She noticed, and apologized for her lack of energy. I asked if she wanted to take a break or a coffee or something, to which she replied ""oh...no...its just the cancer, I don't have as much energy as I used to.""

She went on to explain that she had only months left to live, and she was out with friends who knew of her condition. She just wanted to have fun before the end, ticking off bucket list items, and asked if I could keep going because, in her words, ""sorry but you're probably going to be my last and I don't want it to end so boring.""

I'll admit the revelation was a huge mood killer, and I kind of didn't want to continue - but I was also a horny 26 year old and I took this as a sacred mission. Being her last romp she wanted to try *everything*, and I complied with maximum effort. She swore me to secrecy after the deed was done; we had several mutual friends and she didn't want them to know ""fuck a rando"" was on her list, nor have me branded as the guy who ""fucked a terminal cancer patient"". I heard through the grapevine she passed a few months after and I felt conflicted for months whether I should tell somebody.

We stopped overnight in one town where my dad had acquaintances / friends and that night we had dinner with two ladies, one in her mid 30s and the other in her mid 40s. Anyway everything was fine and I could tell the younger one liked me by the attention she was giving me. She invited me to go to the bar afterwards and long story short we ended up having sex that night at her place. The next morning at the hotel my dad and I were staying I told my dad I needed to run some errands ( workout at the gym, check email at the internet cafe - it was early 2000s) and I’d be gone for a few hours and I’d meet him in back in the room around noon for lunch. I finished early around 11:00am or so and went back upstairs and obviously I have a key to the hotel room and opened the door and caught a glimpse of the same girl I slept with the night before on top of my dad in his bed.

First: My ENT doctor. I had been a patient for about 6 years, at that point. We had bonded over college football since we had graduated from the same university; me four years before him. 

I happened to run into him at the airport departure gate heading to Vegas- I was going for pleasure (meeting friends there) he was going for a conference. 

We ended up sitting next to each other on the flight, (Southwest- open seating) 
and by the time we landed, had plans to meet “for a drink” at his hotel bar the next night.  I ended up staying the night. 

We were (and still are) married (to other people.) My husband knew, and was okay (we are polyamorous) Doc’s wife would not be too happy. 

He’s still my ENT…9 years later.  Subsequent office visits since that trip aren’t even awkward, just friendly and professional. 

Second: Vegas again, 2008. I met a guy at a casino bar..you know the rest. He went to shower, and I asked if I could change the music playing from his laptop. He said sure. I got up, and saw his full name on his laptop. His last name was my maiden name (not at all common!) 

We spent about 25 minutes talking through our family trees, geographical location of our extended families, etc. We lived on opposite sides of the country. 

Best we figured out is his paternal great grandfather was my father’s great uncle  after a second marriage, or something. We were “related,” but not in any way where we could connect currently living relatives together.  My friends still joke about the time I slept with my cousin.

In another concerning bit of information from Mythbusters, the various shops after your security check sell everything needed to create over 2 dozen types of bombs that could destroy a plane.  An anonymous insider released a list online in homes of forcing the airlines and airports to stop selling certain items.  The Mythbusters thought it would be a quick myth to bust and started testing the list.  The Mythbusters discovered the list was in fact real and right.  The Mythbusters handed a list of the base ingredients to the TSA, but most airports refuse to stop selling the items due to those items being very profitable and started to track purchases of those items instead.

She was married to a good guy, but I suspected that he was a little heavy-handed in the marriage. Once, when we were driving to a client meeting several hours away, she asked me who handled the finances in our family. My reply?

""Well, my wife's a CPA, has her degree in finance, and is the CFO of a sizable company. I have an English degree. So her.""

""Oh. We're in a husband-led marriage."" She and her husband went to a fundamentalist church out in the boonies. ""So I just get an allowance from Keith.""

And that was it. Because as well as we got along, I sure wasn't going to cross the line and discuss our respective marriages. First, I have a fantastic one. Second, testifying in someone's divorce trial isn't my idea of fun. I mean, there was no mistaking that she was a beautiful woman with whom I was totally simpatico, but just wasn't going there.

I think she wanted more. For example, several times, she would ask the question, ""How would you describe our relationship?"" My answers were strictly professional.

Then she was diagnosed with cancer. She valiantly fought it for months, but the doctors finally said it was hopeless. I went to visit her at the hospital two weeks before she died, before she went home to die. Her sister was there while her husband was taking their two teenage boys to their baseball game. Nothing got in the way of their baseball, even a dying mother.

Her sister left the room to grab a bite, and we hung out for a bit and chatted. I finally needed to leave, so I bent over to kiss her on the forehead. And she looked up at me and said, ""I love you so much. I wish I had met you earlier in life.""

I come from a big family but we aren't close. I considered her to be like family to me. We had talked about getting married and how we would be in each others weddings.

When she got engaged, she asked me to help plan her bridal shower with another friend of hers. So I did, always naively assuming I would be a bridesmaid. I dropped hundreds of dollars on the bridal shower. I was young then and didn't realize how these things went. I asked her after the bridal shower when I should get my bridesmaod dress. She looked at me blankly and said ""well, we aren't having a big wedding party. It's just my sisters and cousin."" I believed this and let it go. However, at the wedding the truth came out. She had 7 bridesmaids including the friend who helped me plan the bridal shower. As well as her husbands cousin who she just met a few months ago. I was really hurt by this. Especially when she gave a speech and said ""i want to thank the people behind me (her bridesmaids) for always being there for me. You are the closest people in the world to me. Thank you for being here."" I ended up.leaving shortly after that.

We still talk here and there. It was really hard lesson to learn but she isn't the person I thought she was. She still to this day calls me ""sister"", ""family"" etc. I just don't respond when she says that.

Other than that, my wife and I have traveled the US extensively, having visited roughly half the states, even having lived in several.

If you don't live in the United States, or haven't traveled within it, it's not all homogenous. Culture varies greatly. You MIGHT AS WELL be visiting a different country. From the nicest assholes you'll ever meet in New York, to the meth-mouth Taco Bell employee hanging out the drive-thru window in Kentucky, to the country bumpkins of South Dakota who are unaware or uninterested in anything outside their county, to the pretentious assholes who freeze you out in the Pacific Northwest, there is food, and culture, and community all about if you bother to look for it and get down with the locals.

(Don't do meth.)

In the US, we have swamps, and forests, and deserts, and mountains, and plains, and rivers... We've got it all. There is splendid nature and landscape everywhere. There are things to do. The United States is also big. Many states, you can DRIVE for 6-8 hours and STILL be in the same state.

Just a couple weekends ago, there was a Latvian church near me that was hosting a cultural festival. I've NO IDEA what any of the signs said or what any of the food was. Of course everyone spoke English, but their own people within their own community? No idea what their language is even called, or what this denomination of Christianity they call themselves. Open to the public, we were welcomed guests, and I was honored. I was happy to listen to their music and eat their food and buy their wares. Shit like that happens everywhere in this country all the time.

Being a nation of immigrants utterly SURROUNDED by enclaves, I don't have to leave my country to experience a different language or culture.",0,mredding,1754334174.0

So that limits me to Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and maybe a handful of Nordic countries?  I've been to Canada, because that's easy.  Australia is on the other side of the planet.

In book 3 of my fantasy series ""Draganium Legends"", the main character of the book, Flame, was fighting an aquatic dragon, they dragged him into the water and both clawed at each other, going deeper into the ocean. Flame eventually tries to retreat, but the aquatic dragon holds him down to drag him. This is at a point where Flame has to get to the surface soon, else he would drown. They're very deep in the water now, and the aquatic dragon gets completely devoured by a leviathan because they were occupied with the fight. His claws are digging into Flame's tail as this happens, and the aquatic dragon's whole body apart from the wrist to the hand were eaten by the leviathan. Flame swims upward frantically, and the leviathan barely misses a jump as he surfaces, and he manages to escape.",1,Dependent-Swing-5492,1754348479.0

While frozen I am able to be like “Hm… this isn’t something I should be doing.” and then take steps to ensure I’m unable to do anything before my thought process devolves further. I remember angrily searching my room for anything to possibly do it with, furious that I had given up everything I had to my friends to hold onto. I missed having access to a method so badly.

1mhv2zi,"There was this abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, like 30 minutes of backroads to find it and no other people for at least 10 miles in any direction. Me and some friends used to go check out this spooky house and show it off to one or two new folks at a time. We did this three or four times, and as we’re pulling up one night, a light in the house turned on. The house didn’t have power any time we’d been there, and there were no vehicles anywhere around the house that night. Scared us all to the point none of us ever went back.

In retrospect, it was probably being used as a hunting cabin or meth house (although there was never any indication of either that we saw) and they probably just had the breaker off when they weren’t there.

It’s weird because it’s so loud and stops right before the room i’m in when I hear it.

1mhrwue,"All the answers here a filled with insane vitriol. I'm not American, so let me try to describe what I see from afar. First: Trump is just funny. He's (was, maybe) quick witted, he rides the line between vulgar and witty. His Rosie O'Donnel joke was funny in a vulgar way, but, for example, his joke on Biden's expense during the debate was amazing (""I don't know what he said and he probably didn't neither""). He has that ""i got fuck you money"" air about him, that really works on people who have no money, but have pride. He is much more humane and human-like than professional politicians, with their curated opinions and curated voice. He's brash and hot-headed, like an American i've seen in movies. Even when he's obviosly talking out of his ass, it sounds very human, his beef in Twitter with Medvedev was hillarious. In short, he looks like a human being, flawed, arrogant, goofy, in a world of artificial puppets with fake smiles, fake outrages and, ultimately, fake opinions. He's unique and fascinating. After Trump you'll get some meat-puppet like AOC and you'll be lulled into a catatony again.

That's my take.

1mhrwue,"Another theory I have is based on the husband of a good friend that I worked with. He loves Trump. He listens to Fox News 24 seven. He had a rough life. Not actually rougher than a lot of other people’s, but rough nonetheless. He was born with a lame arm. He lost a sister at a young age. He never went to college and was working in manual labor position, such as steel mills, foundries, etc.. because of the time period which were his peak working years, when the mills and the foundry started closing down, he had trouble finding work. He was then forced into jobs that didn’t really pay very well, but he still really busted his ass. He felt like he could not catch a break.  For whatever reason he felt like Trump would pay attention to people like him. And he started buying into the innuendo that his station in life was such as it was because of other races getting ahead of him through government help and foreigners getting preferential treatment. I don’t think any of that was true, but he did.  Now when he lost his job he did receive unemployment insurance and he received food stamps. when the ACA was approved, he actually used it to get heavily subsidize healthcare for his wife and three kids and himself. He does not consider that a handout because after all life was unfair to him and he worked hard. He does kind of be grudge other people that get those types of government assistance.

1mg97j5,"Said it a million times, as an outsider (British) on this whole shit-show -

Epstein is like the US version of the UK's Jimmy Savile, only richer. 

For those not in the know, Savile was a radio DJ (until about 2020, years after Savile died and it all came out, Google gave his name as the answer to ""who invented DJing""...) who later became a TV star, and like Epstein, did a lot for charity. He became friendly with Thatcher when she was PM, Charles and Diana too. Like Epstein, he used his fame, wealth, and charity work to get close to important people and give himself protection. 

I truly believe, and all the evidence points this way, that Savile is much the same as Epstein - used innocent people to cover his tracks. And way more than Savile did. 

I'm pretty far left (quite average in the UK, but the US ""left"" are basically Boris Johnson by comparison) so I don't like Trump at all. I'm not a fan of our Royal Family. But I believe both Prince Andrew and Trump have been ""had"" by Epstein and are being used by actual co-conspirators who are still alive to cover their own tracks. 

Even Epstein described Andrew as ""an idiot, but a useful one"" which fits with his known persona - likes the women, no previous or obvious inclination towards underage girls, also a total moron. 

The problem is the ""Epstein Files"" will simply be flight logs of anyone who went to his island or visited him personally. There won't be a treasure trove of famous politicians abusing kids. People who visited him will include people from both ""sides"" of politics in the US, actors, bankers, businesses folk. Like Jimmy Savile, Epstein kept important/famous people close, with the addition of being a billionaire and being way more connected. 

TL;DR - the real co-abusers are probably people you never heard of. Rich bankers, oligarchs, minor royals from places most Americans couldn't pin on a map. The list is also probably quite small. Predators like Epstein make a habit of keeping their crimes among people they can trust, while keeping their social circle very wide so as to distract from it. 

Trump almost certainly *is* in those files, and this a whole other conversation, but I think he's using this whole thing to disguise other Executive Orders he's passed recently, and to rile up issues for the Democrats when he's nearing the end of this term. He knows ""I was friend's with Epstein and that's proof of nothing"" is correct and goes no further. By keeping people guessing he can ""out"" *other* people who knew him but *also* aren't guilty of crimes, and keep the whole conspiracy of ""maybe they were in on it?"" going when he can't run for president again but can put one of his juniors in his place.",8,RecentTwo544,1754193423.0

It's the norm to just ghost people now rather than deal with the consequences, I'll admit after experiencing it time and time again for the last 6 months I'm starting to do the same.

Dating apps has made dating/relational experiences much more convenient and accessible. So now people are traumatizing each other over and over and over at a higher pace than before and never heal. IMO, there is truth to the idea 'all the good ones are already taken' as you get older. Because couples who met and stayed when they were a lot younger had the opportunity to figure it out when they were 'less traumatized' thus the triggers weren't as loud. They were able to rewire subconscious beliefs of love WHILE they were still developing vs much later when these beliefs become more solidified. I am 32 now and now I am slowly realizing the truth to my patterns &amp; relationships and it's been so painful but eye opening.

* Standards becoming too unrealistic, in my opinion. 
   * As much as I lament being single, I've always been hesitant to try dating apps, because of 
      * The terrible men-to-women ratio
      * The heavy emphasis on outward appearance.
      * People who are on there for... not-genuine reasons.
   * ""Ick"" and ""turnoff lists"" growing to the point where... is there ANY such thing as a turn-on anymore?
   * Reality shows that focus on dating (I'm staring directly at you, The Bachelor). When was the last time you saw people on those shows that weren't magazine material?
* What opportunities are there to meet people anymore? 
   * There is a crowd of women who have taken to social media to tell men, in no uncertain terms, ""do not approach us anywhere ever"". Absolutely not all women do this, but the women who DO do it are VERY loud about it. Because of it, I'm unable to tell these women apart from women who ARE okay with being approached (in the right setting, of course).

  
But the biggest reason for me... single people who love to brag about how happy they are being single.

* *""Well, I'M happy being single, so I don't see why you struggle this much.""*

1mgrjvq,"Honestly, I think AI has made dating more complicated in a few subtle but powerful ways. For one, people are starting to rely on AI for companionship,like virtual girlfriends or chatbots,which can feel emotionally safer than real relationships, but it kind of takes people out of the dating pool emotionally.

Then you’ve got dating apps using AI to match and filter, which sounds good in theory, but it often just leads to swiping fatigue and unrealistic expectations. It's also hard to know if you’re talking to a real person or a perfectly crafted version of them, with AI-written bios and messages.

It’s like we’re all becoming more optimized, but less vulnerable. The emotional risk that real relationships require is kind of getting replaced by this pressure for perfect communication and instant gratification. It’s weirdly more efficient, but also more isolating.

There's so many dating apps and people on them that I don't think this is too difficult. If you match, just be confident and try and plan a date early in the conversation. However, in my experience, most of the women I've met through the apps are very much okay with short-term dating, even if they say they want a long-term relationship. We go on dates and text or talk on the phone for a few weeks but it inevitably ends up dying out. Maybe I've been lucky, but most of the dates I've been on have been nice too. Good chemistry and conversation, they usually offer to split the bill after the first date. Nothing toxic or crazy. I do think a lot of people are lonely, so maybe some settle for some physical intimacy or attention, but get out before it can get serious. Some people seem to be looking for ""perfection,"" so if there's any flaws or ""icks"" they are quick to move on. At the end of the day, relationships are work, and a lot of people just don't want to put in the effort to communicate, plan, or really get to know someone.

Some drunk people who heard his shouting towards her and me thought i tried to dig up a married woman. So they decided to attack me and beat the shit out of me and now i can't walk for two weeks and will most likely have to wait for another 2-3 weeks until i might be able to walk properly again. Keep in mind that SHE basically HUNTED me for weeks and i always said no, because i already felt like sth is wrong with her.

Imagine the only one in your whole life giving you the feeling to be attractive only wants to betray her husband and gets you crippled for over a month.

Like a self fulfilling prophecy almost. That mixed with the lack of accountability and personal growth is more interesting from a story perspective or “content engagement” than a story of success and happiness with finding a person.

You see it all the time where people are celebrating their relationship and others commenting saying how “it’ll never happen to them”, or “this is the exception. Not the rule” kind of attitude that is nothing but defeatist.

And then with guys due to porn, anime and other shit like IG models and the Kardashians they have this u realistic expectations of wanting big tit's with small waist. 

And on the other end Girls have a lot of biases too. They are more height supremacist than they let on. My buddy is about 5'11 and he was getting a match every few weeks and then he tweeked his height to 6 feet and he's getting way more matches than before . I'm like 5'7"" and I feel fucked.

These will be picked up by the men they can manipulate. 

Then you have men who want girls the complete opposite of that but times have changed. Old school parents are gone. The next gen doesn't raise their kids like this. They're floppycocks. They're single moms. They're imbeciles.

Women aren't taught to be women, men aren't taught to be men, and they aren't being taught how they fit together properly. 

Trying results in feminist and liberal cuckbro uproar.

Influencers are raising our kids and the last thing you want is for that to happen.

Dating should be.. man courts woman. Man wants to build a family, leave a legacy. Man needs woman to take care of home and children. Mans gone to work for family. 

Woman (should) want man to provide - and they sure do nowadays - but woman refuse to offer anything the man wants. That is called oppression these days.

1mgrjvq,"As a man in the United States, absolutely. I lived in Brazil for many years and it’s night and day. Here’s the breakdown from ChatGPT:



This isn’t just “better women” vs. “worse women.” It’s a massive cultural shift — one that impacts how attraction, connection, and gender roles play out:

Brazil:

    - •    Warmth and femininity are valued and expressed

    - •    Beauty is aspirational, not taboo

    - •    Men are expected to lead — and appreciated when they do

    - •    Approach culture is alive, not seen as creepy

    - •    There’s less social capital in cynicism and adversarial behavior

USA:

    - •    Women have had to become hyper-independent and guarded to survive — especially in urban environments

    - •    Femininity is often repressed as weakness or submission

    - •    Obesity and lifestyle diseases are normalized and rarely challenged

    - •    Dating apps dominate, and those platforms reward flash over substance, volume over depth

    - •    Many women are emotionally over it before the date even starts — and treat men like liabilities, not possibilities

This sums it up quite well. My experience in Brazil is that women are feminine, beautiful, approachable, and WANT very much so to be a relationship. And when they are in a relationship they are proactive in being affectionate, kind, and showing their men they value them. 

My experience in the USA has been a nightmare. Women are less attractive, overweight, masculine not feminine, and view men with an adversarial mentality with suspicion and disdain. Simultaneously American women don’t seem to have any idea what men really want, nor seem to care.",-3,massivewang,1754273770.0

It’s quite disgusting. These are formative years in a humans life, they only get one window to do it right, and they choose to pressure and bog us down with a bunch of busy work. No wonder why so many people are unfulfilled…when they were supposed to be learning how to be their best self, you’ve trained them to just do a bunch of shit they don’t want to do all day and accept it as the only way. 

Then there’s the fact that the neglect of mental health is almost glorified. I had so many young peers get hardly any sleep many nights due to studying and homework. I was a victim of this as well. If your pressuring kids so much that your messing with their sleep schedules, that is seriously fucked up.

1mhuacz,"Here's mine, back when I was in elementary school (Circa mid 2000s) I was Diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (now known as ASD1) in the second grade. My parents had me tested due to a teacher suggesting that I should get tested (The teacher seemed excited to have someone diagnosed my parents told me) and it came back positive that I was on the spectrum. almost immediately, my elementary school started to treat me as if I was nonverbal.

They would have a helper with me at all times during class even though I did not need one. They had a room that was designed to be a sensory room, but they would have forms of entertainment filling the room making that room more of a goal to be in rather than help. even though it was obvious that I did not require the room they had no limit for the amount of times that I could enter the room. they had me leave the class constantly for mental health classes holding me back academically, they would never require homework to be brought to class.

when I left that school for middle school I was severely underprepared for the amount of change there was . gone was the hand holding, gone were the safety bars that school placed for it. it wasn't until high school that I finally started to get out of that mindset. It wasn't till college that I got to a point mentally for education to fully have an affect on me.

When I was in my early twenties, my Sundays had suddenly morphed into things I should do instead of things I wanted to do.

I decided this sucked. It meant that it was almost a chore day, so Saturday had become almost my only free day. I spoke to my mum and said I’m still happy to do a food shop here and there, I still want to visit my grandma, I’ll still do the food prep and cook, but I don’t want my whole Sunday to be taken up with this. 

Now, I tie in seeing my grandma with visiting other family members, and maybe do a parkrun with friends on the way.

1mhamwe,"Start bringing in more income, start saving, be frugal, and make good investments. At least for me. My problems all revolve around money. For most people who are just surviving, that’s their #1 problem.

If earning more income seems impossible, then saving and investing will be almost impossible too. You can always be more frugal though. 

I’m in this same boat. The way my life is set up, I don’t really have time to work more without losing every minute of family time and sleep that I have. I am managing to save, but very very small amounts, and they’re going straight into stocks because why not? And I’m trying to live frugally without completely cutting out every bit of enjoyment I have.

It’s tough. 

I have found, at least for me, that the two things that help me cope with the mental exhaustion of it all are to 1.) keep myself busy AND 2.) spend time in nature.

I always have a project going on. Most of the time gardening or landscaping. That knocks out two birds with one stone. It keeps me busy, and gives me time in nature. If you’re creative enough, you can do this with scraps (pallet boards, cardboard, plastic) and either cheap plants, cuttings, or start from seed. It can get expensive if you want it to or if you’re ocd and want it to look perfect, but with a little know-how, you can do it very cheaply.

I also (being that I usually get up at 3-4am; before my family wakes up) like to go to this park in town early in the morning that’s next to a Riverbank, and sit there and watch the sunrise (whenever I actually have a day off). 

Go for walks, get fresh air, try to exercise if you can find motivation. These will help you more than anything if you’re struggling financially and can’t find a way out. The fresh air alone will help bring you back into the real world and out of the mental box you’ve put yourself in.

1mhamwe,Okay so as a chronically ill young adult who spent years just getting by but is now happier than ever here’s what I have to say: 1) I found books I loved and wanted to talk to people about. 2) i started socializing while doing things i enjoy (i was in a dnd group for a couple years and had so much fun. Now i volunteer at a reptile rescue and i love it more than anything else ive ever done). 3) I started finding pleasure in small things. I started a garden and even though it’s annoying sometimes all the green makes me so happy. And harvesting things I grew is so special. I also go kayaking (I rent a free kayak at a local park) and look at nature. It’s so nice. I had a hard time getting myself to do anything for a long time. But now my health is the best it has been since 2019 and just not being in pain (or just a lot less pain) 24/7 really changed everything. I finally figured out what I want to do in life (be an exotics vet tech) and have goals and passions. Life is hard but I find things short and long term to be excited about and proud of.

1mhqx7n,"My day was alright. Today, I was reading the forward of this book called *Elements of Interior Design and Decoration* (1937) by Sherrill Whiton. 

What I've learned is that it is the decorative artist's job to help people create better, enthusiastic taste in the arts where they can think more critically about the art they're consuming and learn to appreciate it for why the artist made it, how hard they've worked on it, and what is the meaning behind it; rather than to just buy stuff for the sake of having more stuff because people don't value the spiritual benefits that the products can give them.

It also talks about how the artist must learn to think for theirself -- instead of going with the flow of how things are already done (following already established rules and theories) -- in order to add new ideas to the table that can actually benefit and help civilization move forward.

In order to do this, the artist must study history, culture and philosophy to see what's been done, and how they've been done, in the past and why; because our current time is an inheritance from what happened involving those who came before us.",1,th1nking_th0ughts,1754347402.0

1mhodeo,"There is this game called Werewolf (or also known as Mafia). It is deduction game. Players are secretly assigned roles: most are villagers, a few are werewolves, and some may have special powers (like the seer). Each ""night,"" werewolves secretly eliminate a player. Each ""day,"" all players discuss and vote to eliminate someone they suspect is a werewolf. The goal:

* Villagers win by eliminating all werewolves.
* Werewolves win by outnumbering villagers.

The game depends heavily on hidden information and the ability to interpret social cues.

This game answers your question.

In the beginning, statistically, the werewolfs win more often than the villages, because they have knowledge, that the villagers have. But the more you play in that same group, the more likely it is, that the villagers win. Why? Because the group gets to know each other better. And this knowledge then flips the dynamic.

So up to a point, the werewolfs have more knowledge and hence win more likely. Then, from a certain point, the villagers win more likely, cause they have now more knowledge about the group.",1,DonAzoth,1754342120.0

2. backtest to find a strategy that is proven to have statistical edge over large sample size (minimum of 30 risk units, and ideally &gt;500 risk units). by ""strategy"", i mean a rigid system of rules--or a set of conditions--to follow

If you want a GF, be a good potential BF! Fix your flaws, present a clean and well-kempt version of yourself, look like someone who has a bright future ahead. Improve yourself in the gym, improve your fashion/hygiene, improve your career/wealth, improve your humor/personality, improve your social skills more generally.

Don't forget that ""if you socialize and make yourself available"" part! You could be a millionaire and have a dope body and a great personality... but if you sit at home everyday alone, no one will ever get a chance to meet you and see all the amazing things you have going on.

[The Bronze Age Collapse](https://youtu.be/B965f8AcNbw?si=wlu8IpxwtTz68SUP). Civilizations were begging their enemies for aide not knowing their enemies were already erased. A lot of factors were at play, including famine driven by climate change, but also a mysterious culture that invaded many lands. To this day, we do not who they were or where they came from, but more than one civilization recorded them. 

And then the obvious: the mid 1300s. Around that time, the Golden Horde was laying siege to a city called Caffa. It was a Genoese trading city in Crimea. And what happened during this siege is considered one of the first historical examples of biological warfare. It would have devastating consequences for people far removed from this conflict. 

A mysterious sickness had begun to roll through the golden horde’s camps. It got so bad, the horde abandoned the siege. But before they did, they catapulted their dead over the walls. 

This sickness is what we call the Black Death, and this siege is one of the key vectors that allowed it to enter and devastate Europe.

1mi1gbh,"Go to College…don’t major in English Lit. Make sure your degree at the time will get you a job… Community College first, then a state College. No student loans for me.
